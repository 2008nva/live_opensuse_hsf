The new version 0.8.1 fixes this problem. Everything should work fine again!\n\n+++ Prerequisites: +++\n\nThe Lightning extension needs to be installed.\n\n+++ How to use: +++\n\nCreate a new calendar in Lightning by clicking File>New>Calendar... in the menu bar. Then choose \"On My Computer\" as location and \"Birthdays from the Thunderbird addressbook\" as type for your calendar. Also specify the address book to use as a source for birthdays. Finally choose a name for the new calendar.\n\nNow open the \"Edit Card\" dialog of an address book card, go to the \"Private\" tab and set the birthday including the year. Note that these changes don't take effect in the calendar until it gets reloaded. To do this either restart Thunderbird or right click on a calendar from the list, then choose \"Reload Remote Calendars\".\n\nAlso note that the events generated by ThunderBirthDay cannot be modified with Lightning for the moment. Maybe future versions of the extension will be bidirectional.\n\n+++ Any questions? +++\n\nIf you have any questions about how to install or use the extension, about technical details, bugs or anything else, please let me know! Suggestions for new features are also very welcome! Just send me a mail to thunderbirthday@(mydomain) replacing (mydomain) by ingomueller.net.\n\n+++ Localizing: +++\n\nIf you wish to add a translation for a new language or if you found a mistake in an existing one (including the one in English), I'd be really glad, if you could have a look at the translation portal Babelzilla.

It has been specially designed for Seven (with Aero Style enabled), but it can also be installed on other Windows versions and Linux (just be aware that some things may look different due to differences between platforms).\nIt is not officially available for MAC, but for those who would like to try it anyway on that platform, you can force download and install it and once the package downloaded on your computer, you can install it manually by clicking the \"tools\" button in the add-ons manager and then selecting \"install an add-on from file...\".\nAs FT DeepDark theme for Firefox, It contains no added functionalities, it's simply a full GUI aesthetic customization.\n\n• VERSION 10.0.3 AVAILABLE HERE FOR DOWNLOAD\n\n• WHAT TO DO WHEN FACING AN ISSUE WITH TT DEEPDARK THEME ?\n\n1) before reporting it, first try to see if the issue is due to the theme itself. How ? Enable the default theme and check if the issue is still there. If not, enable again the DeepDark theme, but disable all other installed addons to check if the issue can be due to a conflict between addons.\n\n2) If the issue is still there after disabling all other addons and if the default theme doesn t have that issue, try to download and install again the theme (check also if you have the latest version installed, maybe the bug you want to report has already been solved with the latest updates).\n\n3) if after trying what metioned above the problem is linked with the use of DeepDark theme, please, send me an e-mail (there is a link on the add-ons page to contact me) rather than reporting the bug on the add-ons page. When sending an e-mail to report a bug, do not forget to tell me which operating system (Windows XP, 7, Vista, Linux, etc.) you are running on your computer, which version of Thunderbird and DeepDark theme you are using and if you have any operating system custom theme (it can also be a cause of the issue). Then, describe the most precisely you can the issue you are facing and, if possible, please, join a screenshot and/or a short video so I could see exactly how it looks (English is not my mother tongue as you can easily notice, so a picture can avoid the language problems). All that will help me to understand better what is the problem and to solve it quicker, if possible.\nI can t promise you that I ll manage to fix every problems and also in short time, but I ll do my best for it. I m working on my themes during my free time so it can take a bit time before fixing the issues (you need also to be conscious that any updates need to be checked by Mozilla first, but if you want to have the updates a bit quicker you can follow me on Twitter and know immediately when a new version is available for download).","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":"Free for non-commercial personal use.

For Firefox 24.0 and newer.","fullDescription":"Introduction\n\nColor Transform enables you to adapt the colors of web pages to your taste or need.\n\nThe Color Transform toolbar panel contains 18 buttons for applying a predefined color transformation or 'theme' directly to the active page. The themes are designed so as to obtain readable and predictable results on the majority of web pages.\n\nThe Color Transform toolbar panel also provides 24 buttons for changing the hue, saturation, lightness and opacity (HSLA) of all page colors in the same way. These basic transforms may be used to compose a desired color transformation.\n\nUsage\n\n> To save the (cumulative) color transformation that was applied to the active page, click the top-left button in the panel.\n> To toggle automatic coloration of all opened web pages, click the toolbar button.\n> To apply a saved transform manually, double-click the toolbar button.\n\nThe panel contains four buttons that toggle the inclusion of background colors (fills and gradients), foreground colors (text and borders), background images (background-image elements) and foreground images (image and canvas elements).\n\nTips\n\n> Check out my extension Colorific if you would like to use domain-specific settings or color spectrum previews.\n> Dark content themes are best combined with dark scroll bars (see the New Scrollbars extension) and/or dark Firefox complete themes (like FT Deepdark).\n\nKnown issues\n\n> Color transformation may sometimes be slow, which is usually due to large background images which are referred to in style sheets.\n> Automatic coloration will not apply to style sheets that are modified after the initial load event.

With 28 customizable themes that transform hue, saturation, lightness and opacity. For Firefox 28.0 and above. NEW: Copy themes and group color properties using drag-and-drop.","fullDescription":"Introduction\n\nColorific can be used to colorize entire web pages with 28 customizable themes, which may be associated to web domains for automatic colorization. A few examples of applied themes are shown in the above Screenshots.\n\nTo switch automatic coloration of newly opened web pages on and off, click the Colorific toolbar button. To manually apply a theme to a page, double-click the toolbar button.\n\nThe Colorific toolbar button gives access to the theme editor panel. To see the result of a change to a theme, click the top-left button in the panel to reload the active page and to apply the selected theme to the original page colors.\n\nEach theme may be associated to multiple web domains using the second button in the panel. To merely use these associations as a white list for automatic coloration with the selected theme, toggle the second option in the options box. To also use the stored theme number, toggle the third option.\n\nModifying themes\n\n> Select one of the 28 predefined themes.\n> Each theme may be customized by dragging and dropping 14 property icons into a variable number of color spectra, thus creating groups of properties which may be changed together.\n> The property icons represent HTML elements (image and canvas) and CSS color properties (color, text-shadow, list-style-image, background-color, background-image, box-shadow, border-color-top/left/right/bottom, border-image and outline-color).\n> Each color spectrum defines a transformation for the colors of the properties it contains. This transformation may be specified by dragging sliders for hue, saturation, lightness and opacity (HSLA).\n> Each slider represents a linear range of the original values from 0% to 100% (red to red, black to white, gray to saturated, transparent to opaque), which may be transformed by dragging the two end points of the range.\n> A single color may be selected using the color picker element, but for most properties, images in particular, a range of at least one of the HSL values needs to be chosen in order to retain some contrast.\n\nFor further explanation, see the tool tips on the elements in the panel.\n\nTips\n\n> Check out my extension Color Transform in case you would like to make step-wise changes to page colors or individual elements.\n> The latest versions allow themes to be copied as text by drag-and-drop. You are encouraged to share your own perfect theme in a review on this web site for the benefit of other users - and perhaps your design will make it to the presets!\n> Be careful with the option for colorizing large images, because it can make pages load slowly - normally, leave it switched 'off'. The same is true for the image-to-canvas-backgrounds option - normally, leave it switched 'on'!\n> Dark content themes are best combined with dark scroll bars (see the New Scrollbars extension) and/or dark Firefox complete themes (like FT Deepdark).\n\nKnown issues\n\n> The page content may become visible before coloration is applied, which is annoying for dark themes. Please try the page load timer option in Colorific. A better solution is being worked on.\n> Color transformation may sometimes be slow, which is usually due to large, mostly unused background images which are referred to in style sheets.\n> The automatic color transformation does not apply to styles which are modified after the initial page load event. You may double-click the toolbar button to manually apply a selected theme.\n> Moving image content to canvas backgrounds fails for pages saved as MHT archive, but does work in MAFF archives.\n> Support for Thunderbird will be removed but might be restored once Thunderbird supports CustomizableUI.jsm. The last compatible version remains functional, but you need to prevent it from updating.\n> This extension is affected by the following known bugs in Firefox: bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=700926, 776363, 902636, 958972, 968541.\n\nFuture\n\nPlease donate to enable me to realize the following improvements:\n\n> Support for the upcoming multi-process Firefox (initiated).\n> Use of WebGL for faster color transformation (initiated).\n> Prevention of the flashes of bright tab or page colors before automatic color transformation occurs.\n> Solution for web pages that modify style sheets after the initial load event.\n> Preview of the effect on typical web pages.\n> Transforms in the RGBA/HSVA/HCLA domains.\n> Colorization of the Firefox user interface.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/135/135974.png?src=api&modified=1425239634","width":"700","height":"490","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/135/135974.png?src=api&modified=1425239634","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"140","caption":"Toolbar
