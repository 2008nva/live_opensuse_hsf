Advanced traceroutes with three protocols simultaneously (TCP/UDP/ICMP)\n- ping and traceroute from your computer\n- links to Looking Glasses of 43 global providers (by provider name or by country/city). Not every global provider has an open LG\n- whois, BGP connections on bgp.he.net\n- DNS ping and custom request to any server\n\n- verification of compliance of the website with the IP address, protection against DNS spoofing / DNS hijacking. These attacks are used by different viruses and trojans, some unscrupulous providers, governments and security agencies.\n\nDNS attacks redirect legitimate traffic to a fake website, or when proxying traffic in the Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks for different purposes such as\n\n- stealing passwords\n- listening to internet traffic\n- providing falsified information\n- intercepting online banking transactions\n- for censorship.\n\nDNS requests are sent to a randomly selected server from the list prescribed in the options. To detect DNS spoofing, the address is verified through an external DNS server as well.\n\nBy default, there are the fastest public servers from Google and Level3 in the list. Additionally, it is recommended to use DNS servers from OpenNIC independent of companies and governments (link in the options). Here you can read more about the project.\n\nIf spoofing is suspected, the additional DNS requests to 8.8.8.8 and to the website's DNS server (from NS entries) are possible by using the TCP protocol.\n\nFrom the version 3.0.0, all requests to WIP database will only be sent via https for more protection and security (also against PRISM, xkeyscore, tempora). They will be redirected to the server located on the same continent, where the user is. That is, all European requests are sent to the European server, etc.. Our servers are in the United States, Germany, Chile, Singapore, Japan and Australia.\n\nWorldIP is a WIPmania's product based on WIP-database. Its results are based on data from core routers, so it is more correct than the other databases based on whois (those databases only provide the geographical location of the network owner but not the geographical location of the network itself).\n\nIPv6 support is incomplete and experimental.\nAll requests are asynchronous, so WorldIP does not slow down the site loading time.\n\nIf you noticed a bug, please report it to mail@wipmania.com or via bug report system worldip.userecho.com\n\nIf you constantly get the red spoofing-sign, please check whether your external DNS work. In the menu there is an option \"DNS request/ping\", enter ping there, it might also be with empty fields (by default, the request is sent to the server 8.8.8.8)","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/111/111447.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","width":"345","height":"350","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/111/111447.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","thumbnailWidth":"148","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Popup on Facebook"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/111/111448.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","width":"408","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/111/111448.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","thumbnailWidth":"116","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Menu"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/111/111449.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","width":"691","height":"451","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/111/111449.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"131","caption":"Popups with external DNS for Mozilla page"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/111/111450.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","width":"551","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/111/111450.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","thumbnailWidth":"157","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"DNS spoofing for Baidu.com"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/111/111451.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","width":"428","height":"74","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/111/111451.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"35","caption":"Message about DNS spoofing for Baidu.com"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/112/112628.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","width":"638","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/112/112628.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","thumbnailWidth":"182","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"DNS-ping"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/112/112629.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","width":"638","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/112/112629.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","thumbnailWidth":"182","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"DNS custom request"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/39/39977.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","width":"500","height":"239","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/39/39977.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"95","caption":"Ping and Traceroute from points around the world"}],"averageRating":5,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/worldip/?src=api","homepageURL":"http://www.wipmania.com/en/plugins/","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/231754/worldip_geo_add_on-3.0.8-fx+sm.xpi?src=api","size":799362,"contributionURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/worldip/developers?src=api","contributionAmount":null,"developerComments":"The list of global providers:\nAboveNet, Anders Telecom, Bell Canada, British Telecommunications, Claranet, Cogent Communications, Comstar-Direct, Corbina Telecom, Cable and Wireless, Deutsche Telekom, Easynet, Reliance Globalcom, France Telecom, Global Crossing, GlobalNet, Hurricane Electric, Interoute, IP Triple Play, KPN International, LambdaNet Communications, Level3, Linxtelecom, Limelight Networks, Net Access Corporation, nLayer Communications, NTT Communications, PCCW Global, Packet Clearing House, Primus Telecom, Qwest Communications, Retn.Net, Rogers Telecom, RTCOMM, Savvis, Telecom Italia Sparkle, Sprint, Tata Communications, TDC Data Networks, Telefonica International, TeliaSonera, Tinet, WV Fiber, XO Communications\n\nWIP-Rank is a rating of hosting companies/datacenters\nIt is based on data such as network infrastructure, availability, attendance, and on many other parameters, that allow the most objective assessment of hosting company and their servers.\nPartially, the rating is created on the basis of the site visits, located on company servers.\nWIP-Rank information will be available in the next release of add-on.\nIf you would like to participate in the formation of the rating, just enable the \"WIP-Rank\".\nWe don't collect any personal information!

The visual hashes are produced the same way as in the visual hashing add-on.\n\nThe blue nodes represent individual sites you use, and they're connected, by blue edges, to the green password nodes you use on that site.\n\nYou may also see orange box-shaped nodes that connect two password nodes. These are warnings about password similarity. Password similarity can be a wise and secure tool to use a single password across many different sites, so these warnings are not necessarily bad, or even a call to action. They connect passwords of the same \"family\".","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/66/66766.png?src=api&modified=1326866622","width":"697","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/66/66766.png?src=api&modified=1326866622","thumbnailWidth":"199","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Here's an example visualization for a user with a great deal of password reuse."}],"averageRating":4,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/password-reuse-visualizer/?src=api","homepageURL":"http://connectioni.st/2012/01/visualize-your-password-reuse.html","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/204646/password_reuse_visualizer-0.13-fx.xpi?src=api","size":325874,"developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/password-reuse-visualizer/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":20,"totalDownloads":37699,"weeklyDownloads":42,"dailyUsers":1784,"updateDate":1367620172000,"supportURL":"http://connectioni.st"},{"id":"langpack-es-AR@firefox.mozilla.org","icons":{"32":null,"64":null},"name":"Español (AR) Language Pack","version":"33.0","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"Mozilla","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/mozilla/?src=api"},"description":null,"fullDescription":null,"isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"averageRating":5,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/espa%C3%B1ol-ar-language-pack/?src=api","homepageURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/espa%C3%B1ol-ar-language-pack/?src=api","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/280046/espanol_ar_language_pack-33.0-fx.xpi?src=api","size":433571,"developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/espa%C3%B1ol-ar-language-pack/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":2,"totalDownloads":46885,"weeklyDownloads":346,"dailyUsers":46885,"updateDate":1413223806000,"supportURL":null},{"id":"{d10d0bf8-f5b5-c8b4-a8b2-2b9879e08c5d}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/1/1865-32.png?modified=1401960626","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/1/1865-64.png?modified=1401960626"},"name":"Adblock Plus","type":"extension","version":"2.6.5","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"Wladimir Palant","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/Wladimir-Palant/?src=api"},"description":"Blocks annoying video ads on YouTube, Facebook ads, banners and much more.\n\nAdblock Plus blocks all annoying ads, and supports websites by not blocking unobtrusive ads by default (configurable).","fullDescription":"Adblock Plus allows you to regain control of the internet and view the web the way you want to.

If you often use many many tabs, it will help your web browsing because you can understand relations of tabs.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* You can collapse/expand sub trees. It is convenient for too many tabs.\n* When you close a tab which has collapsed sub tree, all of tabs in the sub tree will be closed only one action.\n* The tree of tabs can be showin at rightside.\n* Vertical tab bar cab be shown/hidden automatically.\n* You can open new tab between existing tabs, dropping link or URL string there.\n* You can save/restore the tree of tabs over sessions, by Session Manager ( https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/2324 ) or other session-management addons.\n* Drag and drop is available to modify relations of tabs and to rearrange. The behavior seems to be like \"layer tree \" of Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop.\n* Tab bar can be moved to leftside, rightside, top, or bottom. Horizontal tree is also available.\n* This has an API for extension authors to open child tabs for existing tabs. (See also http://piro.sakura.ne.jp/xul/_treestyletab.html.en#api )\n\nThis is developed under a project to restructure TBE ( http://piro.sakura.ne.jp/xul/tabextension/index.html.en ) for Firefox 2.

Informational Tab ( https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4930 ) also works. With the Multiple Tab Handler, Firefox becomes like old Firefox powered by TBE.\n\nIf you don't want that Tree Style Tab automatically builds the tree of tabs, you should disable \"extensions.treestyletab.autoAttachNewTabsAsChildren\" by about:config.

For web forms, the typical usage is as follows:\n\n    Navigate to the page containing the login form.\n    Right-click on one of its fields and select from among \"Save login info\" (to create a new entry), \"Edit login info\", and \"Delete login info\".\n    If another popup appears, select the username for the entry you want to operate on.\n    If adding a new entry, everything except the username and password should be filled in automatically. Fill in anything that is missing or incorrect.\n    If adding or editing an entry, reload the page or return later. If the form doesn't get autofilled, most likely the page is asking the browser not to autofill it by declaring autocomplete=\"off\". Try clicking twice on the username field and selecting from the dropdown list. There is a video demonstrating this workaround.\n\nThis add-on also adds commands to the Password Manager window, which it makes accessible through Tools > Saved Passwords as well as a toolbar button.\n\nA short tutorial video is available.\n\nIf you need support, please go to the support web site I have listed or email me (link on the details page, next to this description).

While some of the status bar items did find new homes, you may not have like where they ended up. There were also some nice innovations during the development of Firefox 4, such as putting progress/links/status in the location bar, which unfortunately didn't make it to the final release.\n\nIn Firefox 29, Mozilla decided it would rework the UI again, and ended up removing the Add-on Bar as well.\n\nStatus-4-Evar aims to bring back the Status Bar / Add-on Bar with the familiar classic status bar items, give you more control over the built-in Firefox features, and provide new alternatives.\n\nThe extension provides \"Status Text\", \"Progress Meter\", \"Download Status\", and \"Legacy Status Bar\" (Firefox 29+) items. These toolbar items can be moved wherever you want by customizing the toolbars. Behavior of the toolbar items, and other additional settings, can be controlled in the Status-4-Evar preferences.\n\nThis extension can also act as a replacement for the Fission extension. There are preferences to show links, status, and progress in the location bar instead of the toolbar items.\n\nCheck out the code! S4E is now on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/SparkyBluefang/S4E\n\nWant to provide a translation? Status-4-Evar can be found on BabelZilla:\nhttp://www.babelzilla.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=6532\n\nKnown Issues\n\n    Firefox 4 - 28: by default, there is a flexible space on the Add-on Bar. When you install S4E, this flexible space gets replaced with the Status Text toolbar item. When you disable/uninstall S4E, this toolbar item obviously goes away. To \"fix\" the toolbar, all you have to do is customize the toolbar and put a flexible space between the close button and everything else.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nPlease do not email me for support/help/bug reports. I will not respond and will probably just delete it. The preferred way to contact me is to post in the official support topic on MozillaZine or create an issue on GitHub.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/55/55260.png?src=api&modified=1313365635","width":"700","height":"509","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/55/55260.png?src=api&modified=1313365635","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"145","caption":"S4E provides a handful of toolbar items replicating the functionality of the old status bar.

It moves star & feed buttons to urlbar, adds status bar item to the ui and allows many items to be movable. All features are fully optional. Some buttons have to be moved to toolbars manually using browsers 'customizing' mode.\n\n\nMain features (on options window)\n\n    Tab appearance: Squared classic tabs\n    Tab appearance: Curved tabs (all colored and visible)\n    Tabs not on top + [tabsontop=\"false/true\"] attribute\n    Tabs min/max-width settings\n    Tab close on all tabs, active tab, toolbars start/end\n    Custom colors for tab backgrounds, text and text shadow\n    Application button on toolbars\n    Application button on titlebar [Windows only]\n    Custom application button colors\n    Small navigation toolbar buttons\n    Movable back-forward button\n    Star button in urlbar\n    Feed button in urlbar\n    Movable status-bar panel\n    Combine stop & reload buttons\n    Hide urlbars stop & reload buttons\n    Hide private browsing mask\n    Findbar on top & at the bottom\n    'Icons & Text' and 'Text only' modes\n    Add [iconsize=\"large\"]/[iconsize=\"small\"] attributes to #nav-bar element\n    Compact panel menus (bookmarks, history...)\n    Green/blue identity-box colors for verified websites\n    Replace context icons with labels\n    Add up to 20 additional toolbars (CTR 1.2.5+)\n    Restore tabs empty favicon\n    Replace generic favicon (empty and dotted) with sheet favicon\n    Favicon in urlbars identity box (urlbars left)\n    Different padlock icons\n    Hide navigation toolbar\n    Inverted (white) toolbar button icons\n    Double click on tabs toolbar opens a 'new' tab\n    Hide tabs toolbar with one visible tab\n    Toolbar settings to alter colors, sizes, borders\n    Disable unneeded animations\n    ...and more\n\n\nFeatures (not on options window)\n\n    Enable/disable 'Add-on Bar' (toolbar context menu)\n    Toggle 'Add-on Bar' using 'Ctrl + /' btw. 'Cmd + /'\n    Enable/disable 'Additional Toolbar' (toolbar context menu)\n    Spaces, Flexible spaces, Separators\n    Activity indicator on toolbars\n    Bookmarks menu & sidebar buttons\n    History menu & sidebar buttons\n    Additional movable reload & stop buttons\n    Movable urlbar container\n    Movable (Firefox main) menu button\n    Movable alltabs-button, webrtc-status-button, social-share-button\n    ...and more\n\n\nSquared tabs\nDefault 'curved tabs' can be optionally replaced with classic 'squared tabs'.\nTabs on MacOSX look more like Windows tabs with MacOSX colors on purpose.\n\nCurved alternative tabs\nAll tabs are curved and use colours known from squared tabs.\n\nTabs 'not' on top\nSimulates 'tabs.onTop=false' setting and moves tabs below navigation toolbar. On MacOSX tabs also get a 'reversed appearance'.\n\nApplication button / application menu settings\n\nApplication button on [Firefox] titlebar [Windows only]\nThe titlebar button is fixed on titlebars left side like on Firefox since version 4.0. It is enabled by default on Windows systems.\n\nApplication button on toolbars\nThe button can also be used on toolbars and appears like a default toolbar button.\n\nApplication button colours\nOn tabs toolbar and titlebar application button can be orange, blue (Aurora), black (Nightly), blue (Palemoon), red, green and gray in normal browsing mode and purple in private browsing mode like on previous Firefox versions.\n\nNote\nThe new appmenu is not an exact copy of the old one, but looks as original as possible. The 'splitmenu' is not yet restored, menuitems and submenus are placed in a row. The appmenu also misses some menuitems, which can not be duplicated.\n\nSmall navigation toolbar buttons\nNavigation toolbar buttons get alternative margins and paddings to simulate old 'small icon view'.\n\nHide 'Navigation Toolbar'\nHiding navigation toolbar might be interesting after all items got moved to other toolbars.\n\n'Add-on Bar'\nA toolbar at the bottom of the window. All movable buttons and items can be placed on it. Add-on bar can be enabled/disabled using toolbars context menu (right-click on a toolbar) or using 'Ctrl + /' (Windows/Linux) btw. 'Cmd + /' (MacOSX).\n\n'Additional Toolbar'\nA toolbar between navigation toolbar and bookmarks toolbar. It can be enabled/disabled using toolbars context menu (right-click on a toolbar).\n\nIcons + text / text only mode\nSimilates old modes where text was displayed below toolbar buttons or button icons got hidden.\n\nBookmarks menu button\nA default 'menu button' which opens the 'classic' bookmarks menu. Moved to bookmarks toolbar it also shows its label.\n\nBookmarks and history sidebar buttons\nButtons which toggle bookmarks and history sidebar.\n\nBack-forward, reload and stop buttons\nBrowsers default buttons got merged with urlbar and cannot be moved to different toolbar positions or to different toolbars. CTR adds duplicates of these buttons to the customization palette.\n\nCombined reload-stop button\nPlace reload button AFTER stop button and enable the corresponding option on CTRs preference window. Hovering the option on preference window to get extra information.\nToolbar: [something]...[stop-button][reload-button]...[something]\n\nSpaces, flexible spaces ans separators\nThese toolbar items appear in customizing mode and can be moved to toolbars like on previous Firefox versions.\n\nWindows - Linux - MacOSX\nThis add-on was tested on Windows 7 (AeroBasic, AeroGlass, Classic) & 8(.1) & XP (Classic, Luna-Blue/Silver/Olive, Zune, Royale), Linux Mint KDE, Ubuntu and MacOSX 10.8/10.9. On other Systems or non OS-default themes tab colors may look wrong. Bookmarks, history, stop, reload, back and forward toolbar buttons use default OS icons (Firefox Windows icons on Windows systems, Firefox Mac icons on MacOSX and Firefox Linux icons on Linux systems).\n\nMajor problems with (discontinued?) Foxtab add-on\nIt is strongly recommended to remove Foxtab (v1.0-1.4.11) before installing Firefox 29 or newer, because it breaks Firefox ui for Fx29+. Using Foxtab with CTR breaks the ui even more. If Foxtab is installed and the ui is corrupted, add-ons manager has to be accessed via menubar (rightclick on a toolbar -> select menubar, Tools -> add-ons) and CTR and Foxtab have to be [u]both[/u] uninstalled. After a Firefox restart CTR can be reinstalled again and will work properly.\n\nInfo, known 'issues', 'glitches'\n1) Application menus 'cut', 'copy' and 'paste' buttons do not always work like they should.\n2) Switching between AeroGlass and AeroBasic on Windows 7/Vista can change application buttons position, if the menubar is disabled. Maximizing/restoring browsers main window or restarting Firefox resolves the problem. This glitch is caused by Microsoft Windows and titlebars behavior and not by this add-on.\n3) Tab colors on MacOSX fit to current ui instead of using Firefox 28 colors. This is intended and not a bug.\n4) Do not install this add-on on pre-Australis Firefox (4-28). It is not intended to be used with older versions.\n5) This add-on was made for browsers default theme and will not work properly with all full/complete themes. However most Personas (= [non-complete/light] Themes since 2013) should work fine.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/118/118349.png?src=api&modified=1411056024","width":"167","height":"125","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/118/118349.png?src=api&modified=1411056024","thumbnailWidth":"167","thumbnailHeight":"125","caption":"Main
