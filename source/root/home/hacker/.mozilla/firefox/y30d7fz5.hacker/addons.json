Gets rid of a site's cookies and LocalStorage as soon as you close its tabs. Protects against trackers and zombie-cookies. Trustworthy services can be whitelisted.","fullDescription":"Self-Destructing Cookies is not just a cookie manager, it's a new cookie policy. Do you think that cookies should need a reason to persist in your cookie jar, i.e. you currently interacting with the site that set them? Would you prefer your cookie jar to be empty in its steady state, except for a few sites that you care about? Are you worried about unconventional tracking methods? Then give this add-on a try.\n\nSelf-Destructing Cookies automatically removes cookies when they are no longer used by open browser tabs. With the cookies, lingering sessions, as well as information used to spy on you, will be expunged. Websites will only be permitted to identify you while you actually use them and can not stalk you across the entire web. This is the closest you will get to cookieless browsing without breaking every second site or tedious micromanaging.\n\nTracking cookies will be detected and removed immediately. They are identified purely by their behaviour - no need for a blacklist that needs to be kept up to-date. Self-Destructing Cookies also has LocalStorage support and will treat it just like your cookie jar. Defend yourself against ETag tracking and other cache-based black-hat techniques by configuring Self-Destructing Cookies to automatically clean your cache every time you are not actively using the browser. For the first time ever, this provides a realistic chance of beating zombie-/evercookies without sacrificing usability. See the zombie-cookie FAQ entry for details. Self-Destructing Cookies can also help protect against CSRF attacks by ending your sessions as soon as possible.\n\nThis add-on complements blacklist-based solutions such as Adblock and Ghostery very well. You can whitelist sites whose cookies and LocalStorage you would like to keep without an active tab in the Firefox cookie exception list, which can also be conveniently accessed from the add-on's preferences, or an icon in the Add-on Bar.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions and Common Problems\n\nQ: Will this add-on ever be multi-process (e10s) compatible?\nA: Add-ons can't monitor sites' LocalStorage usage in e10s mode. This functionality will probably never be restored for legacy add-ons such as SDC. This means that the answer is \"very likely never\". You can still force-enable e10s and SDC should clean your cookies just fine, but it can only clean your LocalStorage when the browser starts.\n\nQ: Will this add-on make the jump to the WebExtension world?\nA: I don't have the time for a full rewrite as a WebExtension. Enjoy it while it lasts.\n\nQ: What about Zombie-/Evercookies?\nA: SDC gives you a fighting chance against such black-hat techniques. To beat the Evercookie, enable automatic cache cleaning in SDC's preferences. If you are on a decent, unmetered connection, there is no harm in setting the idle timeout to a low value, such as 3 minutes. You should also set all of your plugins to click-to-play, install BetterPrivacy and configure it to automatically clean unused LSOs. Please note that SDC will not clean LocalStorage scopes of sites served via HTTPS if you are running a Firefox version prior to 23. This is due to a limitation in Firefox's DOM storage API in those versions.\n\nQ: Can I disable the notification pop-ups?\nA: Yes. Open the add-on manager. You can reach it via Firefox's menu, or by just entering \"about:addons\" without the quotes in your location bar. Locate Self-Destructing Cookies in your list of extensions, click the Preferences button and remove the checkmark next to \"Notifications\".\n\nQ: Since I installed the add-on, the removal notifications just won't stop. I'm not even using the browser at the moment.\nA: You are probably using another add-on that re-adds certain cookies when they are removed, e.g. Beef Taco or TrackerBlock which both try to persist opt-out cookies. SDC and the other add-on are having an infinite debate about whether to keep those cookies. Choose a side and disable the other one.\n\nQ: The entire whitelist is empty each time I restart Firefox.\nA: You probably have Firefox's privacy preferences set to \"Clear History when Firefox closes\" and included \"Site Preferences\" in the corresponding menu. SDC's whitelist is stored as site preferences.\n\nQ: A specific site forgets my login, even though it is on my whitelist.\nIf you added the entries manually, make sure you whitelisted the base domains of your sites (e.g. \"example.com\", not \"www.example.com\"). That's where cookies are generally stored.\nIf you added it via the icon, the login might depend on external domains. Keep an eye on the removal notifications the next time you log *in* there. The domains that appear in the following seconds are probably the ones you want on your whitelist as well.\n\nQ: The add-on does not work in private browsing mode.\nA: Some parts of Firefox are off-limits for add-ons while you are in private browsing mode. This includes the cookie jar for example. There's nothing I can do about this, sorry.\n\nQ: I have configured Firefox to block all cookies by default. Can I still use SDC?\nA: There is an unsupported hidden setting that changes the behaviour of the \"yellow\" whitelist level from allow-for-session to allow-while-open. To enable it, create a boolean key in your about:config named \"extensions.jid0-9XfBwUWnvPx4wWsfBWMCm4Jj69E@jetpack.defaultBlock\" (without the quotes), set it to true and restart your browser. You can now use the \"yellow\" setting for sites whose cookies you would like to accept, but still have them self-destruct. I provide this on a \"should work\" basis, meaning that I depend on bug reports from you and don't do in-depth testing of this mode myself.","developerComments":null,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/98/98894.png?src=api&modified=1367914213","width":"650","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/98/98894.png?src=api&modified=1367914213","thumbnailWidth":"186","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Gets rid of a site's cookies as soon as you close its last tab."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/98/98896.png?src=api&modified=1367914213","width":"587","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/98/98896.png?src=api&modified=1367914213","thumbnailWidth":"168","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Detects and removes trackers without the need for a blacklist - purely by their behaviour.

While some of the status bar items did find new homes, you may not have like where they ended up. There were also some nice innovations during the development of Firefox 4, such as putting progress/links/status in the location bar, which unfortunately didn't make it to the final release.\n\nIn Firefox 29, Mozilla decided it would rework the UI again, and ended up removing the Add-on Bar as well.\n\nStatus-4-Evar aims to bring back the Status Bar / Add-on Bar with the familiar classic status bar items, give you more control over the built-in Firefox features, and provide new alternatives.\n\nThe extension provides \"Status Text\", \"Progress Meter\", \"Download Status\", and \"Legacy Status Bar\" (Firefox 29+) items. These toolbar items can be moved wherever you want by customizing the toolbars. Behavior of the toolbar items, and other additional settings, can be controlled in the Status-4-Evar preferences.\n\nThis extension can also act as a replacement for the Fission extension. There are preferences to show links, status, and progress in the location bar instead of the toolbar items.\n\nCheck out the code! S4E is now on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/SparkyBluefang/S4E\n\nWant to provide a translation? Status-4-Evar can be found on BabelZilla:\nhttp://www.babelzilla.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=6532\n\nKnown Issues\n\n    Firefox 4 - 28: by default, there is a flexible space on the Add-on Bar. When you install S4E, this flexible space gets replaced with the Status Text toolbar item. When you disable/uninstall S4E, this toolbar item obviously goes away. To \"fix\" the toolbar, all you have to do is customize the toolbar and put a flexible space between the close button and everything else.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nPlease do not email me for support/help/bug reports. I will not respond and will probably just delete it.

New tabs opened from links (or etc.) are automatically attached to the current tab. If you often use many many tabs, it will help your web browsing because you can understand relations of tabs.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* You can collapse/expand sub trees. It is convenient for too many tabs.\n* When you close a tab which has collapsed sub tree, all of tabs in the sub tree will be closed only one action.\n* The tree of tabs can be showin at rightside.\n* Vertical tab bar cab be shown/hidden automatically.\n* You can open new tab between existing tabs, dropping link or URL string there.\n* You can save/restore the tree of tabs over sessions, by Session Manager ( https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/2324 ) or other session-management addons.\n* Drag and drop is available to modify relations of tabs and to rearrange. The behavior seems to be like \"layer tree \" of Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop.\n* Tab bar can be moved to leftside, rightside, top, or bottom. Horizontal tree is also available.\n* This has an API for extension authors to open child tabs for existing tabs. (See also http://piro.sakura.ne.jp/xul/_treestyletab.html.en#api )\n\nThis is developed under a project to restructure TBE ( http://piro.sakura.ne.jp/xul/tabextension/index.html.en ) for Firefox 2. Multiple Tab Handler ( https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4838 ) can work with this. drag-and-do features of it will be more useful. Informational Tab ( https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4930 ) also works. With the Multiple Tab Handler, Firefox becomes like old Firefox powered by TBE.\n\nIf you don't want that Tree Style Tab automatically builds the tree of tabs, you should disable \"extensions.treestyletab.autoAttach\" by about:config. Then, you'll see tree only when you make a tree by hand, ex. drag and drop.\n\nSimilar Extensions:\nTab Center https://testpilot.firefox.com/experiments/tab-center\nVertical Tabs (Simplified) https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/vertical-tabs-simplified/\nVertical Tabs Reloaded https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/vertical-tabs-reloaded/\nSide Tabs https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/side-tabs/\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nFor developers, Tree Style Tab provides public API. By the API, you'll be able to...\n\n* Open additional information for the current page as a \"child\" tab.\n* Get tabs by the tree structure.

For web forms, the typical usage is as follows:\n\n    Navigate to the page containing the login form.\n    Right-click on one of its fields and select from among \"Save login info\" (to create a new entry), \"Edit login info\", and \"Delete login info\".\n    If another popup appears, select the username for the entry you want to operate on.\n    If adding a new entry, everything except the username and password should be filled in automatically. Fill in anything that is missing or incorrect.\n    If adding or editing an entry, reload the page or return later. If the form doesn't get autofilled, most likely the page is asking the browser not to autofill it by declaring autocomplete=\"off\". Try clicking twice on the username field and selecting from the dropdown list. There is a video demonstrating this workaround.\n\nThis add-on also adds commands to the Password Manager window, which it makes accessible through Tools > Saved Passwords as well as a toolbar button.\n\nA short tutorial video is available.\n\nIf you need support, please go to the support web site I have listed or email me (link on the details page, next to this description).

It should still work on Firefox 52 ESR until ESR moves to Firefox 59 ESR in 2018 (~Q2).\n\nThere is no \"please port it\" or \"please add support for it\" this time, because the entire add-on eco system changes and the technology behind this kind of add-on gets dropped without replacement.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThis add-on restores squared tabs, the application button with application menu (known from Firefox for Windows), the add-on bar, bookmarks/history menu/sidebar buttons and other buttons. It moves star & feed buttons into location bar, adds status bar element to the ui and allows many items to be movable. All features are fully optional. Some buttons have to be moved to toolbars manually using browsers 'customizing' mode.\n\nMain features (on CTRs preferences window)\n\n    Tab appearance: squared tabs (classic)\n    Tab appearance: curved tabs (all colored and visible)\n    Tabs not on top + [tabsontop=\"false/true\"] attribute\n    Tab width and height settings\n    Tab title in Firefox titlebar\n    Tab loading animations\n    Tab close button on all tabs, active tab, toolbars start/end\n    Restore tabs empty favicon\n    Custom 'new tab' page url (Firefox 41+)\n    Double click on tabs toolbar opens 'new' tab [Windows only]\n    Hide tabs toolbar with one visible tab\n    Custom colors for tab backgrounds, text and text shadow\n    Custom tab separators\n    Application button on toolbars (+ icon variations)\n    Application button on titlebar [Windows only]\n    Custom title for application button on titlebar [Windows only]\n    Predefined/custom application button colors\n    Small navigation toolbar buttons\n    Movable back-forward buttons\n    Alternative appearance for preferences/options page\n    Open preferences/options page in a window (simulates preference window)\n    Alternative add-ons manager appearance (Firefox 40+)\n    Show add-ons version number inside add-ons manager (Firefox 40+)\n    Activity indicator (throbber) on toolbars\n    Bookmarks-star button in location bar\n    Rss-Feed button in location bar\n    Old Search UI (Firefox 43+)\n    Movable status-bar panel\n    Old location bar appearance (Firefox 48+)\n    Additional location bar\n    Combine stop & reload buttons\n    Hide location bars stop, reload & go buttons\n    Hide private browsing mask\n    Findbar on top or bottom\n    'Icons & Text' and 'Text only' modes\n    Add [iconsize=\"large\"]/[iconsize=\"small\"] attributes to #nav-bar node\n    Compact panel menus (bookmarks, history...)\n    Green/blue site identity button for verified websites and secure connections\n    Replace context menu icons with labels (Back, Forward...)\n    Add up to 20 additional toolbars to to top browsers area\n    Replace generic favicon with different icons\n    Favicon of a website in locations bars identity button\n    Different padlock icons for secure connections\n    AeroBlue toolbar colors for Windows 8/XP/Classic, Linux, MacOSX\n    Hide navigation toolbar\n    Inverted/white toolbar button icons\n    Predefined toolbar settings to alter colors, sizes, borders\n    Disable some of browsers default ui animations\n    Force some hidden toolbars to appear in fullscreen mode\n    Remove title/menu/tabs toolbars background color (Windows 10)\n    Disable browsers Loop (chat), Reader & Pocket features\n    ...and more\n\n\nFeatures (not on CTRs preferences window)\n\n    about:preferences keeps last selected category/tab\n    'Add-on Bar' (toolbar context menu)\n    Toggle 'Add-on Bar' using 'Ctrl + /' btw. 'Cmd + /'\n    'Additional Toolbar(s)' (toolbar context menu)\n    Spaces, Flexible spaces, Separators\n    Bookmarks menu & sidebar buttons\n    History menu & sidebar buttons\n    Additional movable reload & stop buttons\n    Movable urlbar container\n    Movable main menu button (three lines)\n    ...and more\n\n\nSquared tabs\nDefault 'curved tabs' can be optionally replaced with classic 'squared tabs'.\nTabs on MacOSX look more like Windows tabs with MacOSX colors on purpose.\n\nCurved alternative tabs\nAll tabs are curved and use colours known from squared tabs.\n\nTabs 'not' on top\nSimulates 'tabs.onTop=false' setting and moves tabs below navigation toolbar. On MacOSX tabs also get a 'reversed appearance'.\n\nApplication button / application menu settings\n\nApplication button on [Firefox] titlebar [Windows only]\nThe titlebar button is fixed on titlebars left like on Firefox since version 4.0. It is enabled by default on Windows systems.\n\nApplication button on toolbars\nOn toolbars the button appears like a default toolbar button.\n\nApplication button colours\nOn titlebar and tabs toolbar the application button can be orange, blue (Aurora), black (Nightly), blue (Palemoon), red, green and gray in normal browsing mode and purple in private browsing mode like on previous Firefox versions.\n\nNote\nThe new appmenu is not an exact copy of the old one, but looks as original as possible. The 'splitmenu' will not be restored and the appmenu popup/submenus also miss some non-replicable menuitems.\n\nSmall navigation toolbar buttons\nNavigation toolbar buttons get alternative margins and paddings to simulate old 'small icon view'.\n\nHide 'Navigation Toolbar'\nHiding navigation toolbar might be interesting after content got moved to other toolbars.\n\n'Add-on Bar'\nA toolbar at the bottom of the window. All movable buttons and items can be placed on it. Add-on bar can be enabled/disabled using toolbars context menu (right-click on a toolbar) or using 'Ctrl + /' (Windows/Linux) btw. 'Cmd + /' (MacOSX).\n\n'Additional Toolbar'\nA toolbar between navigation toolbar and bookmarks toolbar. It can be enabled/disabled using toolbars context menu (right-click on a toolbar).\n\nIcons + text / text only mode\nSimulates old icons + text / text modes where text was displayed below toolbar buttons or button icons got hidden.\n\nBookmarks menu button\nA default 'menu button' which opens the 'classic' bookmarks menu. Positioned on bookmarks toolbar the button also displays its label.\n\nBookmarks and history sidebar buttons\nButtons which toggle bookmarks and history sidebar.\n\nBack-forward, reload and stop buttons\nBrowsers default buttons got merged with urlbar and cannot be moved to different toolbar positions or to different toolbars. CTR adds duplicates of these buttons to the customization palette.\n\nCombined reload-stop button\nPlace reload button AFTER stop button and enable the corresponding option on CTRs preference window. Hovering the option on preference window to get extra information.\nToolbar: [something]...[stop-button][reload-button]...[something]\n\nSpaces, flexible spaces and separators\nThese toolbar items appear in customizing mode and can be moved to toolbars like on previous Firefox versions.\n\nWindows - Linux - MacOSX\nThis add-on was tested on Windows 7 (AeroBasic, AeroGlass, Classic) & 8(.1) & 10 & XP (Classic, Luna-Blue/Silver/Olive, Zune, Royale), Linux Mint KDE, Ubuntu and MacOSX 10.8/10.9/10.10/10.11. On other Systems or non OS-default themes tab colors may look wrong. Bookmarks, history, stop, reload, back and forward toolbar buttons use default OS icons (Firefox Windows icons on Windows systems, Firefox Mac icons on MacOSX and Firefox Linux icons on Linux systems).\n\nInfo, known 'issues', 'glitches', problems\n1) Application menus 'cut', 'copy' and 'paste' buttons do not always work like they should.\n2) Switching between AeroGlass and AeroBasic on Windows 7/Vista can change application buttons position, if the menubar is disabled. Maximizing/restoring browsers main window or restarting Firefox resolves the problem. This glitch is caused by Microsoft Windows and titlebars behavior and not by this add-on.\n3) Entering and leaving customizing mode 'disables' right-click menu items for bookmarks inside bookmarks menu button. A restart resolves this issue.\n4) Tab colors on MacOSX fit to current ui instead of using Firefox 28 colors. This is intended and not a bug.\n5) It is strongly recommended to remove Foxtab and Shareaholic before installing Firefox 29 or newer, because both add-ons break Firefox ui in Fx29+. Using Foxtab and/or Shareaholic with CTR causes even more errors, because CTR allows to move/remove more items than the default Firefox does.\nIf one of these add-ons has corrupted the ui, the add-ons manager has to be accessed via menubar (right-click on a toolbar -> select menubar, Tools -> add-ons) and Shareaholic and Foxtab have to be uninstalled and CTR has to be disabled. After a browser restart, CTR can be enabled again. After another restart \"restore defaults\" in customizing mode has to be hit once.\n\n##############################################\n\nIt is recommended to switch to a clean new profile or at least to trigger \"Restore Defaults\" in customizing mode to avoid UI issues after upgrading from Firefox 28 (and older) to Firefox 29 (and newer).\nProfile Switcher add-on and Profilist add-on can help creating new profiles.\n\n##############################################\n\nAVAST AV software,\"Browser Cleanup\" and disappearing Firefox add-ons\nIf Avasts \"Browser Cleanup\" still accidentally removes Firefox add-ons consider removing or disabling \"Browser Cleanup\" feature.\n\n##############################################\n\ngHacks.net article (10 Reasons why you may want to try

WARNING: IF YOU ENABLE ENCRYPTED SESSIONS AND RUN CCLEANER DO NOT ENABLE THE OPTION TO DELETE FIREFOX PASSWORDS. DOING SO WILL WIPE OUT THE KEY3.DB FILE IN YOUR FIREFOX PROFILE AND MAKE IT SO YOUR SESSION MANAGER SESSIONS CAN NOT BE DECRYPTED!\n\n2. Save button / menu item does not work and/or is grayed out - Likely your browser is set to \"Never remember history\" (i.e. permanent private browsing) history in the Privacy options. Due to Mozilla's policy that Add-ons MUST respect private browsing, Session Manager won't allow saving of private windows. This includes in backup sessions. Disable permanent private browsing and you will be able to save non-private windows again. If you don't like this, don't blame me, it's Mozilla's policy. See http://blog.mozilla.com/addons/2010/02/23/private-browsing-support-required-for-add-ons/\n\n3. Recovering from a crash doesn't work - Crash recovery won't work at all if the user sets the option to never remember history or start up in permanent private browsing mode since no crash recovery data is saved by the browser. If you want to be able to recover from crashes don't set the browser to never remember browser history.","eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/61/61138.png?src=api&modified=1341471852","width":"476","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/61/61138.png?src=api&modified=1341471852","thumbnailWidth":"136","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Session

The random selection can be set to include all profiles, desktop profiles only, mobile profiles only or a specific OS family only eg Random Windows Browsers only. There is a large list of profiles which are generally updated for each release. Note: a profile is much more than a simple user agent string\n    The interval at which the random profiles are chosen can be selected when a random option has been selected. The interval can also be random, a specific time period or per session if not set. Note: the time interval dropdown is only shown when it is relevant, so only when a random option is selected\n    Profiles can be excluded from random selection by selecting the checkbox beside the specific profile. Note: the checkboxes only appear when a random option is selected as that is only when they apply\n    The choice of profile and time interval if set in addition to other choices persist between browser restarts unlike other such addons\n    In addition to using the panel to select profiles the RAS context menu item can also be used. The context menu can be toggled on or off in the about:addons page.\n    Note the context menu can only select and indicate selected random options, for selecting a specific profile the panel has to be used.\n    When the context menu is invoked over an email field a list of disposable email services are available to use. A temporary email will be generated and inserted into the email field and the associated temporary email site will be opened in a new tab\n    Notifications can be toggled on or off in the about:addons page\n    Options exist for headers such as the Disable Authorization, Enable DNT (Do Not Track), Spoof If-None-Match (ETags), Via and XFF spoofing, and referer options\n    The Accept headers sent are tailored to the currently selected profile to ensure they match\n    Different tailored Accept language headers can be chosen with an automatic fallback to an en-US variant if the language was not specified for a specific profile\n    Via and XFF ip addresses are validated in real time .

It has been specially designed for Windows 7 (with Aero Style enabled), but it can also be installed on other Windows versions and Linux (just be aware that some things may look different due to differences between platforms). It does NOT officially support Aurora/Firefox Developer Edition, Nightly and any Firefox forked versions (such as Palemoon, Cyberfox, Waterfox, etc.). It is not officially available for MAC, because I can't offer support for this platform in case of issues.\nIt contains no added functionalities, it's simply a full Firefox's GUI aesthetic customization.\n\n• Userstyles to customize a bit more your FT Deepdark (such as : dark \"about:home\", \"aero style\" for tabs and tab bar background, translucent scrollbars, darker url bar background, ...) are available at userstyles.org\n• IMPORTANT ! To use these \"userstyles\" you need first to install an add-on called \"Stylish\"\n\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> IMPORTANT <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\n\nCONCERNS MULTIPROCESSING COMPATIBILITY WITH FIREFOX 54+\nAll complete themes do disable multiprocess mode. This means that it is not an issue specifically related to my theme. Any complete theme you can install will disable it.\nThis was a preventative measure applied by Mozilla to avoid any compatibility problems. Unfortunately there's no easy way to work around this, so users who want to use my theme will be stuck with single-process mode until the programmed end of complete themes (starting Firefox 57). Thanks for your understanding\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\n\n• Before posting a review, please take the time to read first the review guidelines described here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/review_guide. Thank you.\n\n\n• WHAT TO DO WHEN FACING AN ISSUE WITH FT DEEPDARK?\n\n1) before reporting it, first try to see if the issue is due to the theme itself. How ? Enable the default theme and check if the issue is still there. If not, enable again the FT theme, but disable all other installed addons to check if the issue can be due to a conflict between addons.\n\n2) If the issue is still there after disabling all other addons and if the default theme doesn t have that issue, try to download and install again the theme (check also if you have the latest version installed, maybe the bug you want to report has already been solved with the latest updates).\n\n3) if after trying what mentioned above the problem is linked with the use of the FT theme, please, send me an e-mail (there is a link on the add-ons page to contact me) instead of reporting the bug in the add-on's review section. When sending an e-mail to report a bug, do not forget to tell me which operating system (Windows XP, 7, Vista, Linux, etc.) you are running on your computer, which version of Firefox and FT theme you are using and if you have any operating system custom theme (it can also be a cause of the issue). Then, describe the most precisely you can the issue you are facing and, if possible, please, join a screenshot and/or a short video so I could see exactly how it looks (English is not my mother tongue, so a picture can avoid the language problems). All that will help me to understand better what is the problem and to solve it quicker if possible.\nI can t promise you that I ll manage to fix every problems and also in short time, but I ll do my best for it. I m working on my themes during my free time so it can take a bit time before fixing the issues (you need also to be conscious that any updates need to be checked by Mozilla first, but if you want to have the updates a bit quicker you can follow me on Twitter and know immediately when a new version is available for download).","developerComments":"Special thanks to :\n\nAxel G., Ken S., Ken B. and Ivana R.","eula":"Free for non-commercial personal use.

As you continue to change your passwords and update your password manager, the picture will improve!\n\nStart the visualization by clicking on the blue padlock in the add-on bar.\n\nThe visualization is fairly intuitive, but here's a quick summary of what this tool will tell you.\n\nThe green nodes represent distinct passwords you use. Hover over them to see a visual hash of your password, and click to view your password in clear text. The visual hashes are produced the same way as in the visual hashing add-on.\n\nThe blue nodes represent individual sites you use, and they're connected, by blue edges, to the green password nodes you use on that site.\n\nYou may also see orange box-shaped nodes that connect two password nodes. These are warnings about password similarity. Password similarity can be a wise and secure tool to use a single password across many different sites, so these warnings are not necessarily bad, or even a call to action.

Yet, even after adding Fanboy's two extra lists, hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers, uBlock Origin still has a lower memory footprint than other very popular blockers out there.\n\nAlso, be aware that selecting some of these extra lists may lead to higher likelihood of web site breakage -- especially those lists which are normally used as hosts file.\n\n***\n\nFree.\nOpen source with public license (GPLv3)\nFor users by users.\n\nIf ever you really do want to contribute something, think about the people working hard to maintain the filter lists you are using, which were made available to use by all for free.\n\n***\n\nDocumentation:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin\n\nProject change log:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases\n\nContributors @ Github:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/graphs/contributors\n\nContributors @ Crowdin:\nhttps://crowdin.net/project/ublock","developerComments":null,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157572.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157572.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Default mode"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157576.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157576.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"The dashboard: stock filter lists"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157592.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157592.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Dynamic filtering allows default-deny mode"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/159/159634.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/159/159634.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"The dashboard: settings"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/158/158734.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","width":"700","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/158/158734.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Unified logger"}],"homepageURL":"https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin","learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/?src=api","supportURL":"https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/support-ublock-origin/6746","averageRating":5,"reviewCount":1996,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/reviews/?src=api","totalDownloads":27006497,"weeklyDownloads":383955,"dailyUsers":3904201,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/685614/ublock_origin-1.13.8-an+fx+sm+tb.xpi?src=api","repositoryStatus":4,"size":1728718,"updateDate":1500484240000,"isPlatformCompatible":true},{"id":"jid1-HdwPLukcGQeOSh@jetpack","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/496/496120-32.png?modified=1459527616","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/496/496120-64.png?modified=1459527616"},"type":"extension","name":"Location Guard","version":"1.2.3","creator":{"name":"Marco Stronati","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/paracetamolo/?src=api"},"developers":[{"name":"Kostas Chatzikokolakis","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/chatziko/?src=api"}],"description":"Hide your geographic location from websites.

Your geographic location is obtained through various means (eg. using wifi data) and is often highly accurate, which can be a violation of your privacy.\n\nThis extension allows you to enjoy the useful applications of geolocation while protecting your privacy. It does so by reporting a fake location to websites, obtained by adding a certain amount of \"noise\" to the real location. The noise is randomly selected in a way that ensures that the real location cannot be inferred with high accuracy.\n\nThree configurable privacy levels are provided. The higher the privacy level the greater the amount of noise, which gives better privacy at the expense of a less accurate fake location. This can be configured per-website for flexibility: a more accurate location can be provided for driving directions than for a weather forecast. There's also an option to use a fixed location, instead of adding noise to the real one. This offers the best privacy (no dependence on the real location at all), at the cost of very low accuracy.\n\nNote: your location can be also detected from your IP address, but usually with poor accuracy. Location Guard protects the accurate location revealed through the javascript API.","developerComments":null,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/152/152196.png?src=api&modified=1422927979","width":"640","height":"400","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/152/152196.png?src=api&modified=1422927979","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"125","caption":"Location guard in use on openstreetmap.org"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/152/152198.png?src=api&modified=1422927979","width":"640","height":"400","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/152/152198.png?src=api&modified=1422927979","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"125","caption":"Privacy levels configuration."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/152/152264.png?src=api&modified=1422927980","width":"364","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/152/152264.png?src=api&modified=1422927980","thumbnailWidth":"104","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Location Guard on Android."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/152/152266.png?src=api&modified=1422927980","width":"367","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/152/152266.png?src=api&modified=1422927980","thumbnailWidth":"105","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Options page on Android."}],"homepageURL":"https://github.com/chatziko/location-guard","learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/location-guard/?src=api","supportURL":"https://github.com/chatziko/location-guard/issues","averageRating":4,"reviewCount":41,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/location-guard/reviews/?src=api","totalDownloads":469866,"weeklyDownloads":861,"dailyUsers":17953,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/419849/location_guard-1.2.3-fx+an.xpi?src=api","repositoryStatus":4,"size":295175,"updateDate":1459524460000,"isPlatformCompatible":true},{"id":"pwgen@alouche.net","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/12/12441-32.png?modified=1356655339","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/12/12441-64.png?modified=1356655339"},"type":"extension","name":"pwgen - Password Generator","version":"0.5.2.1-signed.1-signed","creator":{"name":"Ali Abbas","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/ali-abbas/?src=api"},"description":"For Sysadmins / Network Engineers / and why not everybody who needs a quick password generator.. simple, yet efficient.","fullDescription":"pwgen, stands for \"password - generator\".

Nobody else decides for you: You choose. You are in full control of your privacy.\n\nOut of the box, uMatrix works in relax block-all/allow-exceptionally mode, meaning web sites which require 3rd-party scripts are likely to be \"broken\". With two clicks, uMatrix can be set to work in allow-all/block-exceptionally mode, which generally will not break web sites. See https://github.com/gorhill/httpswitchboard/wiki/How-to-use-HTTP-Switchboard:-Two-opposing-views for more details on this topic.\n\n* See ALL the remote connections, failed or attempted, depending on whether they were blocked or allowed (you decide).\n\n* A single-click to whitelist/blacklist one or multiple classes of requests according to the destination and type of data (a blocked request will NEVER leave your browser).\n\n* Efficient blacklisting: cookies won't leave your browser, JavaScript won't execute, plugins won't play, tracking pixels won't download, etc.\n\n* You do not have to solely rely on just one particular curated blacklist (arguably with many missing entries) outside which nothing else can be blocked: You are in full control.\n\n* Ease of use: uMatrix lets you easily whitelist/blacklist net requests which originate from within a web page according to a point-and-click matrix:\n\n- domain names (left column)\n* from very specific\n* to very generic\n\n- type of requests (top row)\n* cookies\n* CSS-related resources (stylesheets and web fonts)\n* images\n* plugins\n* scripts\n* XHR (requests made by scripts)\n* frames\n* others\n\nYou can blacklist/whitelist a single cell, an entire row, a group of rows, an entire column, or the whole matrix with just one click.\n\nuMatrix's filtering engine uses precedence logic to evaluate what is blocked/allowed according to which cells are blacklisted/whitelisted. For example, this allows you to whitelist a whole page with one click, without having to repeatedly whitelist whatever new data appear on the page.\n\nAll rules are scoped. For example, you can block `facebook.com` and `facebook.net` everywhere except when visiting a page on `www.facebook.com`. This way Facebook won't be able to build a profile of your browsing habits.\n\nThe goal of this extension is to make the allowing or blocking of web sites, wholly or partly, as straightforward as possible, so as to encourage users to care about their privacy.\n\nThe extension comes with 3rd-party hosts files totaling over 62,000 distinct hostnames (lists can be selectively disabled/enabled according to your choice).\n\nUltimately, you can choose however you browse the net:\n\n* Blacklist all by default, and whitelist as needed (default mode).\n\n* Whitelist all by default, and blacklist as needed.\n\nEither way, you still benefit from the preset blacklists so that at least you get basic protection from trackers, malware sites, etc. Or you can disable all of these preset blacklists.\n\nYour choice.\n\nRandomly assembled documentation: https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/wiki\n\n=====\n\nThis extension is also useful to understand what the web page in your browser is doing, often without your knowledge. You have full ability to see and decide with whom a web page communicates, and to restrict these communications to specific classes of objects within the web page.\n\nThe number which appear in the extension icon correspond to the total number of distinct requests attempted (successfully or not depending on whether these were allowed or blocked) by the web page.\n\nSimply click on the appropriate entry in the matrix in order to white-, black- or graylist a component. Graylisting means the blocked or allowed status will be inherited from another cell with higher precedence in the matrix.\n\nRed square = effectively blacklisted, i.e. requests are prevented from reaching their intended destination:\n* Dark red square: the domain name and/or type of request is specifically blacklisted.\n* Faded red square: the blacklist status is inherited because the entry is graylisted.\n\nGreen square = effectively whitelisted, i.e. requests are allowed to reach their intended destination:\n* Dark green square: the domain name and/or type of request is specifically whitelisted.\n* Faded green square: the whitelist status is inherited because the entry is graylisted.\n\nThe top-left cell in the matrix, the \"all\" cell, represents the default global setting, which allows you to choose whether allowing or blocking everything is the default behavior. Some prefer to allow everything while blocking exceptionally. My personal preference is of course the reverse, blocking everything and allowing exceptionally.\n\nThis extension is also useful if you wish to speed up your browsing, by globally blocking all requests for images as an example.\n\n=====\n\nBUGS, ISSUES: https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/issues\n\nSOURCE CODE: https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix (GPLv3)\n\nCHANGE LOG: https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/releases","developerComments":null,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/158/158458.png?src=api&modified=1431417020","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/158/158458.png?src=api&modified=1431417020","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Point and click to allow/block narrow or broad classes of network requests.
