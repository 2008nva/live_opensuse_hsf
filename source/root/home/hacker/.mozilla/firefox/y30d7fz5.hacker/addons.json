Advanced traceroutes with three protocols simultaneously (TCP/UDP/ICMP)\n- ping and traceroute from your computer\n- links to Looking Glasses of 43 global providers (by provider name or by country/city). Not every global provider has an open LG\n- whois, BGP connections on bgp.he.net\n- DNS ping and custom request to any server\n\n- verification of compliance of the website with the IP address, protection against DNS spoofing / DNS hijacking. These attacks are used by different viruses and trojans, some unscrupulous providers, governments and security agencies.\n\nDNS attacks redirect legitimate traffic to a fake website, or when proxying traffic in the Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks for different purposes such as\n\n- stealing passwords\n- listening to internet traffic\n- providing falsified information\n- intercepting online banking transactions\n- for censorship.\n\nDNS requests are sent to a randomly selected server from the list prescribed in the options. To detect DNS spoofing, the address is verified through an external DNS server as well.\n\nBy default, there are the fastest public servers from Google and Level3 in the list. Additionally, it is recommended to use DNS servers from OpenNIC independent of companies and governments (link in the options). Here you can read more about the project.\n\nIf spoofing is suspected, the additional DNS requests to 8.8.8.8 and to the website's DNS server (from NS entries) are possible by using the TCP protocol.\n\nFrom the version 3.0.0, all requests to WIP database will only be sent via https for more protection and security (also against PRISM, xkeyscore, tempora). They will be redirected to the server located on the same continent, where the user is. That is, all European requests are sent to the European server, etc.. Our servers are in the United States, Germany, Chile, Singapore, Japan and Australia.\n\nWorldIP is a WIPmania's product based on WIP-database.

With this add-on, you can visualize your passwords and the sites you use them on. By looking at this visualization, you can get a quick idea of which passwords you've been using the most, and the kinds of sites you're using them on. As you continue to change your passwords and update your password manager, the picture will improve!\n\nStart the visualization by clicking on the blue padlock in the add-on bar.\n\nThe visualization is fairly intuitive, but here's a quick summary of what this tool will tell you.\n\nThe green nodes represent distinct passwords you use. Hover over them to see a visual hash of your password, and click to view your password in clear text. The visual hashes are produced the same way as in the visual hashing add-on.\n\nThe blue nodes represent individual sites you use, and they're connected, by blue edges, to the green password nodes you use on that site.\n\nYou may also see orange box-shaped nodes that connect two password nodes. These are warnings about password similarity. Password similarity can be a wise and secure tool to use a single password across many different sites, so these warnings are not necessarily bad, or even a call to action. They connect passwords of the same \"family\".","developerComments":null,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/66/66766.png?src=api&modified=1326866622","width":"697","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/66/66766.png?src=api&modified=1326866622","thumbnailWidth":"199","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Here's an example visualization for a user with a great deal of password reuse."}],"homepageURL":"http://connectioni.st/2012/01/visualize-your-password-reuse.html","learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/password-reuse-visualizer/?src=api","supportURL":"http://connectioni.st","averageRating":4,"reviewCount":20,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/password-reuse-visualizer/reviews/?src=api","totalDownloads":38038,"weeklyDownloads":29,"dailyUsers":1546,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/204646/password_reuse_visualizer-0.13-fx.xpi?src=api","repositoryStatus":4,"size":325874,"updateDate":1367620172000,"isPlatformCompatible":true},{"id":"langpack-es-AR@firefox.mozilla.org","icons":{"32":null,"64":null},"name":"Español (AR) Language Pack","version":"35.0","creator":{"name":"Mozilla","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/mozilla/?src=api"},"description":null,"fullDescription":null,"developerComments":null,"eula":null,"homepageURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/espa%C3%B1ol-ar-language-pack/?src=api","learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/espa%C3%B1ol-ar-language-pack/?src=api","supportURL":null,"averageRating":5,"reviewCount":2,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/espa%C3%B1ol-ar-language-pack/reviews/?src=api","totalDownloads":52263,"weeklyDownloads":392,"dailyUsers":52263,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/292686/espanol_ar_language_pack-35.0-fx.xpi?src=api","repositoryStatus":4,"size":463569,"updateDate":1421089707000,"isPlatformCompatible":true},{"id":"langpack-pt-PT@firefox.mozilla.org","icons":{"32":null,"64":null},"name":"Português Portugal Language Pack","version":"35.0","creator":{"name":"Mozilla","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/mozilla/?src=api"},"description":null,"fullDescription":null,"developerComments":null,"eula":null,"homepageURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/portugu%C3%AAs-portugal-language/?src=api","learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/portugu%C3%AAs-portugal-language/?src=api","supportURL":null,"averageRating":5,"reviewCount":1,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/portugu%C3%AAs-portugal-language/reviews/?src=api","totalDownloads":49160,"weeklyDownloads":445,"dailyUsers":49160,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/292772/portugues_portugal_language_pack-35.0-fx.xpi?src=api","repositoryStatus":4,"size":448988,"updateDate":1421089791000,"isPlatformCompatible":true},{"id":"{d10d0bf8-f5b5-c8b4-a8b2-2b9879e08c5d}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/1/1865-32.png?modified=1417705367","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/1/1865-64.png?modified=1417705367"},"type":"extension","name":"Adblock Plus","version":"2.6.7","creator":{"name":"Wladimir Palant","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/Wladimir-Palant/?src=api"},"description":"Blocks annoying video ads on YouTube, Facebook ads, banners and much more.\n\nAdblock Plus blocks all annoying ads, and supports websites by not blocking unobtrusive ads by default (configurable).","fullDescription":"Adblock Plus allows you to regain control of the internet and view the web the way you want to.

entries in the password manager.","fullDescription":"This extension allows you to enter data into the Password Manager database instead of relying on Firefox, Thunderbird, SeaMonkey, etc., to do it, as well as making changes to existing entries. For web forms, the typical usage is as follows:\n\n    Navigate to the page containing the login form.\n    Right-click on one of its fields and select from among \"Save login info\" (to create a new entry), \"Edit login info\", and \"Delete login info\".\n    If another popup appears, select the username for the entry you want to operate on.\n    If adding a new entry, everything except the username and password should be filled in automatically. Fill in anything that is missing or incorrect.\n    If adding or editing an entry, reload the page or return later. If the form doesn't get autofilled, most likely the page is asking the browser not to autofill it by declaring autocomplete=\"off\". Try clicking twice on the username field and selecting from the dropdown list. There is a video demonstrating this workaround.\n\nThis add-on also adds commands to the Password Manager window, which it makes accessible through Tools > Saved Passwords as well as a toolbar button.\n\nA short tutorial video is available.\n\nIf you need support, please go to the support web site I have listed or email me (link on the details page, next to this description). Never use a review for this, as I have no real way of contacting you. For anything else, please see the Developer Comments near the bottom of the details page.\n\nBitcoin donations: 12EtZBWKUgk4ss1yiFSj57tPoUwEtkTXEm (or contact me to ask for a separate address). Suggested amount 0.01-0.02 BTC.","developerComments":"Currently supported applications: Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, and Conkeror.\n\nIf you find this add-on useful, you might find QuickPasswords useful as well. For those more stubborn sites where the Password Manager and this add-on completely fail, try iMacros for Firefox.\n\nLogo/icon by PlastikManiac — thanks.\n\nYou can find the source code repository at GitHub. To report bugs, you may use the issue tracker there, or just use the support email link in the \"About this add-on\" section. Please email me for any other support requests.\n\nTranslations welcome.

New tabs opened from links (or etc.) are automatically attached to the current tab. If you often use many many tabs, it will help your web browsing because you can understand relations of tabs.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* You can collapse/expand sub trees. It is convenient for too many tabs.\n* When you close a tab which has collapsed sub tree, all of tabs in the sub tree will be closed only one action.\n* The tree of tabs can be showin at rightside.\n* Vertical tab bar cab be shown/hidden automatically.\n* You can open new tab between existing tabs, dropping link or URL string there.\n* You can save/restore the tree of tabs over sessions, by Session Manager ( https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/2324 ) or other session-management addons.\n* Drag and drop is available to modify relations of tabs and to rearrange. The behavior seems to be like \"layer tree \" of Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop.\n* Tab bar can be moved to leftside, rightside, top, or bottom. Horizontal tree is also available.\n* This has an API for extension authors to open child tabs for existing tabs. (See also http://piro.sakura.ne.jp/xul/_treestyletab.html.en#api )\n\nThis is developed under a project to restructure TBE ( http://piro.sakura.ne.jp/xul/tabextension/index.html.en ) for Firefox 2. Multiple Tab Handler ( https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4838 ) can work with this. drag-and-do features of it will be more useful. Informational Tab ( https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4930 ) also works. With the Multiple Tab Handler, Firefox becomes like old Firefox powered by TBE.\n\nIf you don't want that Tree Style Tab automatically builds the tree of tabs, you should disable \"extensions.treestyletab.autoAttachNewTabsAsChildren\" by about:config.

While some of the status bar items did find new homes, you may not have like where they ended up. There were also some nice innovations during the development of Firefox 4, such as putting progress/links/status in the location bar, which unfortunately didn't make it to the final release.\n\nIn Firefox 29, Mozilla decided it would rework the UI again, and ended up removing the Add-on Bar as well.\n\nStatus-4-Evar aims to bring back the Status Bar / Add-on Bar with the familiar classic status bar items, give you more control over the built-in Firefox features, and provide new alternatives.\n\nThe extension provides \"Status Text\", \"Progress Meter\", \"Download Status\", and \"Legacy Status Bar\" (Firefox 29+) items. These toolbar items can be moved wherever you want by customizing the toolbars. Behavior of the toolbar items, and other additional settings, can be controlled in the Status-4-Evar preferences.\n\nThis extension can also act as a replacement for the Fission extension. There are preferences to show links, status, and progress in the location bar instead of the toolbar items.\n\nCheck out the code! S4E is now on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/SparkyBluefang/S4E\n\nWant to provide a translation? Status-4-Evar can be found on BabelZilla:\nhttp://www.babelzilla.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=6532\n\nKnown Issues\n\n    Firefox 4 - 28: by default, there is a flexible space on the Add-on Bar. When you install S4E, this flexible space gets replaced with the Status Text toolbar item. When you disable/uninstall S4E, this toolbar item obviously goes away. To \"fix\" the toolbar, all you have to do is customize the toolbar and put a flexible space between the close button and everything else.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nPlease do not email me for support/help/bug reports. I will not respond and will probably just delete it.

It is enabled by default on Windows systems.\n\nApplication button on toolbars\nOn toolbars the button appears like a default toolbar button.\n\nApplication button colours\nOn titlebar and tabs toolbar the application button can be orange, blue (Aurora), black (Nightly), blue (Palemoon), red, green and gray in normal browsing mode and purple in private browsing mode like on previous Firefox versions.\n\nNote\nThe new appmenu is not an exact copy of the old one, but looks as original as possible. The 'splitmenu' will not be restored and the appmenu popup/submenus also miss some non-replicable menuitems.\n\nSmall navigation toolbar buttons\nNavigation toolbar buttons get alternative margins and paddings to simulate old 'small icon view'.\n\nHide 'Navigation Toolbar'\nHiding navigation toolbar might be interesting after content got moved to other toolbars.\n\n'Add-on Bar'\nA toolbar at the bottom of the window. All movable buttons and items can be placed on it. Add-on bar can be enabled/disabled using toolbars context menu (right-click on a toolbar) or using 'Ctrl + /' (Windows/Linux) btw. 'Cmd + /' (MacOSX).\n\n'Additional Toolbar'\nA toolbar between navigation toolbar and bookmarks toolbar. It can be enabled/disabled using toolbars context menu (right-click on a toolbar).\n\nIcons + text / text only mode\nSimulates old icons + text / text modes where text was displayed below toolbar buttons or button icons got hidden.\n\nBookmarks menu button\nA default 'menu button' which opens the 'classic' bookmarks menu. Positioned on bookmarks toolbar the button also displays its label.\n\nBookmarks and history sidebar buttons\nButtons which toggle bookmarks and history sidebar.\n\nBack-forward, reload and stop buttons\nBrowsers default buttons got merged with urlbar and cannot be moved to different toolbar positions or to different toolbars. CTR adds duplicates of these buttons to the customization palette.\n\nCombined reload-stop button\nPlace reload button AFTER stop button and enable the corresponding option on CTRs preference window. Hovering the option on preference window to get extra information.\nToolbar: [something]...[stop-button][reload-button]...[something]\n\nSpaces, flexible spaces and separators\nThese toolbar items appear in customizing mode and can be moved to toolbars like on previous Firefox versions.\n\nWindows - Linux - MacOSX\nThis add-on was tested on Windows 7 (AeroBasic, AeroGlass, Classic) & 8(.1) & XP (Classic, Luna-Blue/Silver/Olive, Zune, Royale), Linux Mint KDE, Ubuntu and MacOSX 10.8/10.9. On other Systems or non OS-default themes tab colors may look wrong. Bookmarks, history, stop, reload, back and forward toolbar buttons use default OS icons (Firefox Windows icons on Windows systems, Firefox Mac icons on MacOSX and Firefox Linux icons on Linux systems).\n\nMajor problems with (discontinued?) Foxtab and Shareaholic add-ons\nIt is strongly recommended to remove Foxtab and Shareaholic before installing Firefox 29 or newer, because both break Firefox ui in Fx29+. Using Foxtab and/or Shareaholic with CTR breaks the ui even more.\nIf one of these add-ons already has corrupted the ui, the add-ons manager has to be accessed via menubar (right-click on a toolbar -> select menubar, Tools -> add-ons) and CTR, Shareaholic and Foxtab have to be uninstalled.\nAfter Firefox has been restarted, \"restore defaults\" in customizing mode has to be hit once. CTR can be reinstalled afterwards and will work properly.\n\nInfo, known 'issues', 'glitches'\n1) Application menus 'cut', 'copy' and 'paste' buttons do not always work like they should.\n2) Switching between AeroGlass and AeroBasic on Windows 7/Vista can change application buttons position, if the menubar is disabled. Maximizing/restoring browsers main window or restarting Firefox resolves the problem. This glitch is caused by Microsoft Windows and titlebars behavior and not by this add-on.\n3) Entering and leaving customizing mode 'disables' right-click menu items for bookmarks inside bookmarks menu button. A restart resolves this issue.\n4) Tab colors on MacOSX fit to current ui instead of using Firefox 28 colors. This is intended and not a bug.\n5) Do not install this add-on on pre-Australis Firefox (4-28). It is not intended to be used with old browser versions.\n6) This add-on was made for browsers default theme and will not work with all full/complete themes properly. However most Personas/LW-Themes work fine.\n\n##############################################\n\ngHacks.net article (10 Reasons why you may want to try Firefox’s Classic Theme Restorer
