computer.\n\nIt provides the following advantages over the built-in save system:\n— A complete page can be saved as a single file (web archive)\n— You can name files using the title of the page (title save)\n— The saved pages are faithful to the original (exact save)\n\nYou can view and save MHT (MHTML) files, with excellent compatibility with Internet Explorer;\nbut more importantly, you can use the MAFF file format, with the following advantages:\n— Save disk space, since MAFF files are compressed\n— Include video and audio embedded in the pages\n— Be universal, since MAFF is based on ZIP and compatible with Linux and other platforms\n— Use an open format, with no risk of vendor lock-in\n\nThe MAFF format is exceptional when combined with the built-in browser support for the Ogg Vorbis and Ogg Theora media formats in web pages: you can save everything in a single file. You can even save more than one tab in a single MAFF file.\n\nThe MAF extension allows you to convert your already saved pages to the format of your choice. You can use this feature to save disk space, or even to convert MAFF to the other formats, should you ever decide to go back.\n\nMAF also interoperates with other extensions, for example:\n— Multiple Tab Handler (easily select the tabs to save)\n— UnMHT (additional expert features to read and write MHTML)\n\nThe MAF extension is intuitive and easy to use, but empowers you with advanced features: see the user manual if you want to find out more!\n\nDo you think something could be improved? Let us know!\n\nBut don't forget to check out the latest development version first: maybe the feature you need is already there!","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/54/54953.png?src=api&modified=1299930039","width":"310","height":"229","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/54/54953.png?src=api&modified=1299930039","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"147","caption":"By default, you will find new menu options dedicated to saving a web page in a single file.

Anti-phishing. Protection against DNS spoofing and fake sites. All DNS records for domain. The real location of web server, country flag, extended information about datacenter","fullDescription":"FF29 does not have add-on bar anymore, therefore if you want to see all infos bottom, you have to install \"The Addon Bar\" (for Firefox29) additionally for some useful add-ons\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/the-addon-bar/\n\nPlease report the bugs you found here worldip.userecho.com\n\nWorldIP provides the following information:\n\n- all IP addresses of the server (IPv4 and IPv6), Reverse DNS, web-server\n- all DNS entries for domains (A,AAAA,MX,NS,SPF,TXT,SOA,CNAME,PTR), their Time to Live (TTL)\n- real country, flag\n- data center, provider, autonomous system (AS)\n- your external IP address, ISP and change log (by time or when changing proxy)\n\n- ping and traceroute from all continents (around 40 servers worldwide). Advanced traceroutes with three protocols simultaneously (TCP/UDP/ICMP)\n- ping and traceroute from your computer\n- links to Looking Glasses of 43 global providers (by provider name or by country/city). Not every global provider has an open LG\n- whois, BGP connections on bgp.he.net\n- DNS ping and custom request to any server\n\n- verification of compliance of the website with the IP address, protection against DNS spoofing / DNS hijacking. These attacks are used by different viruses and trojans, some unscrupulous providers, governments and security agencies.\n\nDNS attacks redirect legitimate traffic to a fake website, or when proxying traffic in the Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks for different purposes such as\n\n- stealing passwords\n- listening to internet traffic\n- providing falsified information\n- intercepting online banking transactions\n- for censorship.\n\nDNS requests are sent to a randomly selected server from the list prescribed in the options. To detect DNS spoofing, the address is verified through an external DNS server as well.\n\nBy default, there are the fastest public servers from Google and Level3 in the list. Additionally, it is recommended to use DNS servers from OpenNIC independent of companies and governments (link in the options). Here you can read more about the project.\n\nIf spoofing is suspected, the additional DNS requests to 8.8.8.8 and to the website's DNS server (from NS entries) are possible by using the TCP protocol.\n\nFrom the version 3.0.0, all requests to WIP database will only be sent via https for more protection and security (also against PRISM, xkeyscore, tempora). They will be redirected to the server located on the same continent, where the user is. That is, all European requests are sent to the European server, etc.. Our servers are in the United States, Germany, Chile, Singapore, Japan and Australia.\n\nWorldIP is a WIPmania's product based on WIP-database. Its results are based on data from core routers, so it is more correct than the other databases based on whois (those databases only provide the geographical location of the network owner but not the geographical location of the network itself).\n\nIPv6 support is incomplete and experimental.\nAll requests are asynchronous, so WorldIP does not slow down the site loading time.\n\nIf you noticed a bug, please report it to mail@wipmania.com or via bug report system worldip.userecho.com\n\nIf you constantly get the red spoofing-sign, please check whether your external DNS work. In the menu there is an option \"DNS request/ping\", enter ping there, it might also be with empty fields (by default, the request is sent to the server 8.8.8.8)","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/111/111447.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","width":"345","height":"350","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/111/111447.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","thumbnailWidth":"148","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Popup on Facebook"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/111/111448.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","width":"408","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/111/111448.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","thumbnailWidth":"116","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Menu"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/111/111449.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","width":"691","height":"451","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/111/111449.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"131","caption":"Popups with external DNS for Mozilla page"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/111/111450.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","width":"551","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/111/111450.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","thumbnailWidth":"157","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"DNS spoofing for Baidu.com"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/111/111451.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","width":"428","height":"74","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/111/111451.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"35","caption":"Message about DNS spoofing for Baidu.com"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/112/112628.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","width":"638","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/112/112628.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","thumbnailWidth":"182","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"DNS-ping"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/112/112629.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","width":"638","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/112/112629.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","thumbnailWidth":"182","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"DNS custom request"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/39/39977.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","width":"500","height":"239","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/39/39977.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"95","caption":"Ping and Traceroute from points around the world"}],"averageRating":5,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/worldip/?src=api","homepageURL":"http://www.wipmania.com/en/plugins/","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/231754/worldip_geo_add_on-3.0.8-fx+sm.xpi?src=api","size":799362,"developerComments":"The list of global providers:\nAboveNet, Anders Telecom, Bell Canada, British Telecommunications, Claranet, Cogent Communications, Comstar-Direct, Corbina Telecom, Cable and Wireless, Deutsche Telekom, Easynet, Reliance Globalcom, France Telecom, Global Crossing, GlobalNet, Hurricane Electric, Interoute, IP Triple Play, KPN International, LambdaNet Communications, Level3, Linxtelecom, Limelight Networks, Net Access Corporation, nLayer Communications, NTT Communications, PCCW Global, Packet Clearing House, Primus Telecom, Qwest Communications, Retn.Net, Rogers Telecom, RTCOMM, Savvis, Telecom Italia Sparkle, Sprint, Tata Communications, TDC Data Networks, Telefonica International, TeliaSonera, Tinet, WV Fiber, XO Communications\n\nWIP-Rank is a rating of hosting companies/datacenters\nIt is based on data such as network infrastructure, availability, attendance, and on many other parameters, that allow the most objective assessment of hosting company and their servers.\nPartially, the rating is created on the basis of the site visits, located on company servers.\nWIP-Rank information will be available in the next release of add-on.\nIf you would like to participate in the formation of the rating, just enable the \"WIP-Rank\".\nWe don't collect any personal information!

New tabs opened from links (or etc.) are automatically attached to the current tab. If you often use many many tabs, it will help your web browsing because you can understand relations of tabs.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* You can collapse/expand sub trees. It is convenient for too many tabs.\n* When you close a tab which has collapsed sub tree, all of tabs in the sub tree will be closed only one action.\n* The tree of tabs can be showin at rightside.\n* Vertical tab bar cab be shown/hidden automatically.\n* You can open new tab between existing tabs, dropping link or URL string there.\n* You can save/restore the tree of tabs over sessions, by Session Manager ( https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/2324 ) or other session-management addons.\n* Drag and drop is available to modify relations of tabs and to rearrange. The behavior seems to be like \"layer tree \" of Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop.\n* Tab bar can be moved to leftside, rightside, top, or bottom. Horizontal tree is also available.\n* This has an API for extension authors to open child tabs for existing tabs. (See also http://piro.sakura.ne.jp/xul/_treestyletab.html.en#api )\n\nThis is developed under a project to restructure TBE ( http://piro.sakura.ne.jp/xul/tabextension/index.html.en ) for Firefox 2. Multiple Tab Handler ( https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4838 ) can work with this. drag-and-do features of it will be more useful. Informational Tab ( https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4930 ) also works. With the Multiple Tab Handler, Firefox becomes like old Firefox powered by TBE.\n\nIf you don't want that Tree Style Tab automatically builds the tree of tabs, you should disable \"extensions.treestyletab.autoAttachNewTabsAsChildren\" by about:config. Then, you'll see tree only when you make a tree by hand, ex. drag and drop.\n\nSimilar Extensions:\nPano (tree in the sidebar, based on Panorama) https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/pano/\nTab Utilities (all-in-one addon for tabbed browsing, including vertical tab bar and tab groups) https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tab-utilities/\nTab Kit (all-in-one addon for tabbed browsing, including vertical tab bar and tree of tabs) https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/5447/\nVertical Tabs (alternative for TST + Multiple Tab Handler) https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/108862/\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nFor developers, Tree Style Tab provides public API. By the API, you'll be able to...\n\n* Open additional information for the current page as a \"child\" tab.\n* Get tabs by the tree structure. For example, \"parent\", array of \"children\", next/previous \"sibling\", and so on.\n* Collapse and expand sub tree.\n* Observe changing of collapsed state of sub tree.\n\nMore information, see:

While some of the status bar items did find new homes, you may not have like where they ended up. There were also some nice innovations during the development of Firefox 4, such as putting progress/links/status in the location bar, which unfortunately didn't make it to the final release.\n\nIn Firefox 29, Mozilla decided it would rework the UI again, and ended up removing the Add-on Bar as well.\n\nStatus-4-Evar aims to bring back the Status Bar / Add-on Bar with the familiar classic status bar items, give you more control over the built-in Firefox features, and provide new alternatives.\n\nThe extension provides \"Status Text\", \"Progress Meter\", \"Download Status\", and \"Legacy Status Bar\" (Firefox 29+) items. These toolbar items can be moved wherever you want by customizing the toolbars. Behavior of the toolbar items, and other additional settings, can be controlled in the Status-4-Evar preferences.\n\nThis extension can also act as a replacement for the Fission extension. There are preferences to show links, status, and progress in the location bar instead of the toolbar items.\n\nCheck out the code! S4E is now on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/SparkyBluefang/S4E\n\nWant to provide a translation? Status-4-Evar can be found on BabelZilla:\nhttp://www.babelzilla.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=6532\n\nKnown Issues\n\n    Firefox 4 - 28: by default, there is a flexible space on the Add-on Bar. When you install S4E, this flexible space gets replaced with the Status Text toolbar item. When you disable/uninstall S4E, this toolbar item obviously goes away. To \"fix\" the toolbar, all you have to do is customize the toolbar and put a flexible space between the close button and everything else.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nPlease do not email me for support/help/bug reports. I will not respond and will probably just delete it. The preferred way to contact me is to post in the official support topic on MozillaZine or create an issue on GitHub.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/55/55260.png?src=api&modified=1313365635","width":"700","height":"509","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/55/55260.png?src=api&modified=1313365635","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"145","caption":"S4E provides a handful of toolbar items replicating the functionality of the old status bar.

On MacOSX these tabs have reverse appearance like on pre-Australis builds.\n\nApplication button / application menu settings\n\nApplication menu titlebar button [Windows only]\nThe appmenu titlebar button is fixed on titlebars left side like on it was since Fx 4. It is enabled by default on Windows systems.\n\nApplication menu toolbar button\nThe appmenu toolbar button is a default toolbar menu button and can be placed on any available toolbar.\nIf it is moved to tabs toolbar while the menubar is disabled, the appbutton appears on browsers titlebar (Windows only). Otherwise it appears like a default toolbar button placed on any toolbar.\n\nApplication button colors\nOn tabs toolbar and on titlebar the appbutton can be colored orange, blue (Aurora), black (Nightly), transparent, blue (Palemoon), red, green and gray [in normal browsing mode] and purple [in private browsing mode] like on previous Windows browser versions.\n\nNote\nThe new appmenu is not an exact copy of the old one, but looks as original as possible. Some elements like 'splitmenu' are not available in Firefox Australis anymore, so menuitem and a submenu are placed in a row now. The appmenu also misses some non-cloneable menuitems inside developer- and options submenus.\n\nSmall nav-bar buttons\nNavigation toolbar buttons get alternative margins and paddings to simulate small icon view.\n\nHide 'Navigation Toolbar'\nHiding nav-bar might be interesting after its items get moved to other toolbars.\n\n'Add-on Bar'\nA toolbar at windows bottom simulates the 'old' add-on bar. All movable buttons and items can be placed on it. Add-on bar can be accessed through toolbars context menu (right-click on an existing toolbar) or can be toggled using 'Ctrl+/' (Windows/Linux) btw. 'Cmd+/' (MacOSX).\n\n'Additional Toolbar'\nAnother toolbar below top toolbars, where buttons and items can be moved to. It can be accessed through toolbars context menu (right-click on an existing toolbar).\n\nFindbar on top or at the bottom\nForces findbar to be displayed on top or at the bottom.\n\nIcons + text\nDisplay text below toolbar buttons.\n\nText only\nReplace toolbar button icons with text.\n\nBookmarks menu button\nThe bookmarks menu button is a default 'toolbar menu button'. On personal toolbar its label and icon are visible.\n\nBookmarks sidebar button\nThe bookmarks sidebar button toggles the bookmarks sidebar.\n\nHistory sidebar button\nThe history sidebar button toggles the history sidebar.\n\nBack-forward, reload and stop buttons\nBrowsers default buttons got merged with urlbar and cannot be moved to different toolbar positions or to different toolbars. CTB recreates these buttons.\n\nCombined reload-stop button\nPlace stop and reload buttons in that order on any toolbar and enable the corresponding option on CTRs preference window. Hover the option on options window to get extra information.\nToolbar: [something]...[stop-button][reload-button]...[something]\n\nSpaces and flexible spaces\nA couple of toolbar items simulate spaces and flexible spaces. They can be moved to toolbars like toolbar buttons using browsers customize menu.\n\nWindows - Linux - MacOSX\nThis add-on was tested on Windows 7 (AeroBasic, AeroGlass, Classic) & 8 & XP (Classic, Luna-Blue/Silver/Olive, Zune, Royale), Linux Mint KDE, Ubuntu and MacOSX 10.8/10.9. On other Systems or non OS-default themes tab colors may look wrong. Bookmarks, history, stop, reload, back and forward toolbar buttons use default OS icons (Firefox Windows icons on Windows systems, Firefox Mac icons on MacOSX and Firefox Linux icons on Linux systems).\n\nKnown 'issues'/'glitches'/extra info\n1) Application menus 'cut', 'copy' and 'paste' buttons do not always work like they should.\n2) Switching between AeroGlass and AeroBasic on Windows 7/Vista can change application buttons position, if the menubar is disabled. Maximizing/restoring browsers main window or restarting Firefox reslves the problem. This glitch is caused by MS Windows and titlebars behavior and not by this add-on.\n3) Tab colors on MacOSX fit to current ui instead of using pre-Australis colors. This is intended and not a bug.\n\nNotes\n1) Do not install this add-on on pre-Australis Firefox (4-28). It is not intended to be used with older versions and will certainly break some parts of the UI or not work correctly at all.\n2) This add-on was made for browsers default theme and will certainly break parts of the UI especially tabs, if used along with Firefox themes or Personas, but additional buttons and their options could work fine (untested!).","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/118/118349.png?src=api&modified=1396443041","width":"167","height":"125","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/118/118349.png?src=api&modified=1396443041","thumbnailWidth":"167","thumbnailHeight":"125","caption":"Main

Once I've sorted that I'll update the addon.\n\n    24/5/2011 - Harder than I thought to add support for a user specified key so have submitted version 1.2 with a dedicated shortcut key (alt + t) whilst I work on a user specified key.\n\n    8/8/2011 - New version (1.4) now available. Fixed the French locale and added a Dutch locale.\n\n    28/5/2011 - Didn't realise alt+t would cause a problem as a shortcut key on Windows (doesn't on OS-X), have modified it to alt+x, tested on OS-X and Windows with no problems seen.
