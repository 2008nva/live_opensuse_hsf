Advanced traceroutes with three protocols simultaneously (TCP/UDP/ICMP)\n- ping and traceroute from your computer\n- links to Looking Glasses of 43 global providers (by provider name or by country/city). Not every global provider has an open LG\n- whois, BGP connections on bgp.he.net\n- DNS ping and custom request to any server\n\n- verification of compliance of the website with the IP address, protection against DNS spoofing / DNS hijacking. These attacks are used by different viruses and trojans, some unscrupulous providers, governments and security agencies.\n\nDNS attacks redirect legitimate traffic to a fake website, or when proxying traffic in the Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks for different purposes such as\n\n- stealing passwords\n- listening to internet traffic\n- providing falsified information\n- intercepting online banking transactions\n- for censorship.\n\nDNS requests are sent to a randomly selected server from the list prescribed in the options. To detect DNS spoofing, the address is verified through an external DNS server as well.\n\nBy default, there are the fastest public servers from Google and Level3 in the list. Additionally, it is recommended to use DNS servers from OpenNIC independent of companies and governments (link in the options). Here you can read more about the project.\n\nIf spoofing is suspected, the additional DNS requests to 8.8.8.8 and to the website's DNS server (from NS entries) are possible by using the TCP protocol.\n\nFrom the version 3.0.0, all requests to WIP database will only be sent via https for more protection and security (also against PRISM, xkeyscore, tempora). They will be redirected to the server located on the same continent, where the user is. That is, all European requests are sent to the European server, etc.. Our servers are in the United States, Germany, Chile, Singapore, Japan and Australia.\n\nWorldIP is a WIPmania's product based on WIP-database. Its results are based on data from core routers, so it is more correct than the other databases based on whois (those databases only provide the geographical location of the network owner but not the geographical location of the network itself).\n\nIPv6 support is incomplete and experimental.\nAll requests are asynchronous, so WorldIP does not slow down the site loading time.\n\nIf you noticed a bug, please report it to mail@wipmania.com or via bug report system worldip.userecho.com\n\nIf you constantly get the red spoofing-sign, please check whether your external DNS work. In the menu there is an option \"DNS request/ping\", enter ping there, it might also be with empty fields (by default, the request is sent to the server 8.8.8.8)","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/111/111447.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","width":"345","height":"350","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/111/111447.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","thumbnailWidth":"148","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Popup on Facebook"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/111/111448.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","width":"408","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/111/111448.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","thumbnailWidth":"116","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Menu"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/111/111449.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","width":"691","height":"451","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/111/111449.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"131","caption":"Popups with external DNS for Mozilla page"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/111/111450.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","width":"551","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/111/111450.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","thumbnailWidth":"157","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"DNS spoofing for Baidu.com"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/111/111451.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","width":"428","height":"74","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/111/111451.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"35","caption":"Message about DNS spoofing for Baidu.com"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/112/112628.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","width":"638","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/112/112628.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","thumbnailWidth":"182","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"DNS-ping"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/112/112629.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","width":"638","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/112/112629.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","thumbnailWidth":"182","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"DNS custom request"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/39/39977.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","width":"500","height":"239","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/39/39977.png?src=api&modified=1380060648","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"95","caption":"Ping and Traceroute from points around the world"}],"averageRating":5,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/worldip/?src=api","homepageURL":"http://www.wipmania.com/en/plugins/","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/231754/worldip_geo_add_on-3.0.8-fx+sm.xpi?src=api","size":799362,"contributionURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/worldip/developers?src=api","contributionAmount":null,"developerComments":"The list of global providers:\nAboveNet, Anders Telecom, Bell Canada, British Telecommunications, Claranet, Cogent Communications, Comstar-Direct, Corbina Telecom, Cable and Wireless, Deutsche Telekom, Easynet, Reliance Globalcom, France Telecom, Global Crossing, GlobalNet, Hurricane Electric, Interoute, IP Triple Play, KPN International, LambdaNet Communications, Level3, Linxtelecom, Limelight Networks, Net Access Corporation, nLayer Communications, NTT Communications, PCCW Global, Packet Clearing House, Primus Telecom, Qwest Communications, Retn.Net, Rogers Telecom, RTCOMM, Savvis, Telecom Italia Sparkle, Sprint, Tata Communications, TDC Data Networks, Telefonica International, TeliaSonera, Tinet, WV Fiber, XO Communications\n\nWIP-Rank is a rating of hosting companies/datacenters\nIt is based on data such as network infrastructure, availability, attendance, and on many other parameters, that allow the most objective assessment of hosting company and their servers.\nPartially, the rating is created on the basis of the site visits, located on company servers.\nWIP-Rank information will be available in the next release of add-on.\nIf you would like to participate in the formation of the rating, just enable the \"WIP-Rank\".\nWe don't collect any personal information!

Design your browser with your favorite font.","fullDescription":"Theme Font & Size Changer is a simple browser tool that lets you change the font size and font family of Firefox. It is especially valuable tool for visually impaired people and wide screen users.\n\nDifferent from add-ons that enlarge and reduce text on web pages, Theme Font & Size Changer changes the font size and font family in all windows, menus, toolbars, etc within Firefox itself. All font size and font family changes are instantly applied and they are saved permanently and through sessions. You may assign your favorite font into your browser interface and change its size as you wish.\n\nIt was initially created to be an accessibility aid for persons with visual impairments and for those without perfect eyesight, but it's also useful for Firefox users with high resolution settings and wide screens.\n\nWhile Theme Font & Size Changer was written to be used with Firefox default theme, it does work with other non-default themes, but you may come across issues where some elements within Firefox retain the (non-default) font size setting that the theme developer chose for their theme.\n\nThere are two places that you can manage the global font size and font family of Firefox via Theme Font & Size Changer:\nToolbar Button: Click on the Theme Font & Size Changer button to open up Theme Font & Size Changer settings panel.\nTools Option: Choose Tools menu from Firefox Menu Bar and click on the Theme Font & Size Changer option. It will open up Theme Font & Size Changer settings panel.\n\nIn Theme Font & Size Changer settings panel, Font section provides fonts currently installed on your operating system. With this option set, you will be able to fine tune your font family of Firefox theme. Theme Font & Size Changer does not supply you with fonts, it allows you to use fonts that are already installed on your operating system which provides a greater selection.\n\nIn Size section, simply select a font size value (from 6 to 80 pixels) and the changes will be applied instantly and globally.\n\nTheme Font & Size Changer also allows you to change the global font size and font family for the user interface in Thunderbird and SeaMonkey.\n\nFIREFOX USERS:\nthe Theme Font & Size Changer button is added to the right side of the Navigation Toolbar by default. You can move it to any toolbar that you wish including the Status Bar by right clicking on a toolbar, selecting Customize, and dragging the icon to the toolbar of your choice.\nTHUNDERBIRD USERS:\n\nStatusbar Bar Button: Click on the Theme Font & Size Changer button inside your Thunderbird status-bar.\n\nTools Option: Choose Tools menu from Thunderbird Menu Bar and click on the Theme Font & Size Changer option. It will open up Theme Font & Size Changer settings panel.\n\nSEAMONKEY USERS:\n\nStatusbar Bar Button: Click on the Theme Font & Size Changer button inside your Thunderbird status-bar.\n\nToolbar Button: It is optional so it is not visible as default. If you want to place a Toolbar Button, right click on a toolbar button like Home Button, then choose Customize option. A window will pop up. Find the Theme Font & Size Changer button, then click and drag the Theme Font & Size Changer button in the toolbar of your choice and drop the button. Clicking on this Theme Font & Size Changer button will open up Theme Font & Size Changer settings panel.\n\nPlease do not send your support or help questions as review.

New tabs opened from links (or etc.) are automatically attached to the current tab. If you often use many many tabs, it will help your web browsing because you can understand relations of tabs.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* You can collapse/expand sub trees. It is convenient for too many tabs.\n* When you close a tab which has collapsed sub tree, all of tabs in the sub tree will be closed only one action.\n* The tree of tabs can be showin at rightside.\n* Vertical tab bar cab be shown/hidden automatically.\n* You can open new tab between existing tabs, dropping link or URL string there.\n* You can save/restore the tree of tabs over sessions, by Session Manager ( https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/2324 ) or other session-management addons.\n* Drag and drop is available to modify relations of tabs and to rearrange. The behavior seems to be like \"layer tree \" of Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop.\n* Tab bar can be moved to leftside, rightside, top, or bottom. Horizontal tree is also available.\n* This has an API for extension authors to open child tabs for existing tabs. (See also http://piro.sakura.ne.jp/xul/_treestyletab.html.en#api )\n\nThis is developed under a project to restructure TBE ( http://piro.sakura.ne.jp/xul/tabextension/index.html.en ) for Firefox 2. Multiple Tab Handler ( https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4838 ) can work with this. drag-and-do features of it will be more useful. Informational Tab ( https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4930 ) also works. With the Multiple Tab Handler, Firefox becomes like old Firefox powered by TBE.\n\nIf you don't want that Tree Style Tab automatically builds the tree of tabs, you should disable \"extensions.treestyletab.autoAttachNewTabsAsChildren\" by about:config. Then, you'll see tree only when you make a tree by hand, ex. drag and drop.\n\nSimilar Extensions:\nPano (tree in the sidebar, based on Panorama) https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/pano/\nTab Utilities (all-in-one addon for tabbed browsing, including vertical tab bar and tab groups) https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tab-utilities/\nTab Kit (all-in-one addon for tabbed browsing, including vertical tab bar and tree of tabs) https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/5447/\nVertical Tabs (alternative for TST + Multiple Tab Handler) https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/108862/\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nFor developers, Tree Style Tab provides public API. By the API, you'll be able to...\n\n* Open additional information for the current page as a \"child\" tab.\n* Get tabs by the tree structure. For example, \"parent\", array of \"children\", next/previous \"sibling\", and so on.\n* Collapse and expand sub tree.\n* Observe changing of collapsed state of sub tree.\n\nMore information, see: http://piro.sakura.ne.jp/xul/_treestyletab.html.en#api","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/30/30844.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","width":"324","height":"360","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/30/30844.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","thumbnailWidth":"135","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Overview"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/16/16932.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","width":"212","height":"143","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/16/16932.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"134","caption":"Drag-and-drop of tabs"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/16/16933.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","width":"296","height":"259","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/16/16933.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","thumbnailWidth":"171","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"with \"Multiple Tab Handler\""},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/16/16934.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","width":"294","height":"345","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/16/16934.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","thumbnailWidth":"127","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"with \"Informational Tab\""},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/30/30845.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","width":"632","height":"139","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/30/30845.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"43","caption":"Horizontal tree tabs below the content area"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/30/30846.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","width":"273","height":"296","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/30/30846.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","thumbnailWidth":"138","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"\"Metal\" theme, a built-in style for Mac OS X"}],"averageRating":4,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/?src=api","homepageURL":"http://piro.sakura.ne.jp/xul/_treestyletab.html.en","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/258152/tree_style_tab-0.14.2014051101-fx.xpi?src=api","size":1298787,"developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":937,"totalDownloads":2355825,"weeklyDownloads":4641,"dailyUsers":93888,"updateDate":1399904668000,"supportURL":"https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab/issues"},{"id":"eliteproxyswitcher@my-proxy.com","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/addon_icons/186/186387-32.png?modified=1398821561","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/addon_icons/186/186387-64.png?modified=1398821561"},"name":"Elite Proxy Switcher","type":"extension","version":"1.2.0.2","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"My-Proxy","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/my-proxy/?src=api"},"description":"Change Firefox proxy with great ease.","fullDescription":"It shows the current proxy settings in the status bar.

For web forms, the typical usage is as follows:\n\n    Navigate to the page containing the login form.\n    Right-click on one of its fields and select from among \"Save login info\" (to create a new entry), \"Edit login info\", and \"Delete login info\".\n    If another popup appears, select the username for the entry you want to operate on.\n    If adding a new entry, everything except the username and password should be filled in automatically. Fill in anything that is missing or incorrect.\n    If adding or editing an entry, reload the page or return later. If the form doesn't get autofilled, most likely the page is asking the browser not to autofill it by declaring autocomplete=\"off\". Try clicking twice on the username field and selecting from the dropdown list. There is a video demonstrating this workaround.\n\nThis add-on also adds commands to the Password Manager window, which it makes accessible through Tools > Saved Passwords as well as a toolbar button.\n\nA short tutorial video is available.\n\nIf you need support, please go to the support web site I have listed or email me (link on the details page, next to this description).

While some of the status bar items did find new homes, you may not have like where they ended up. There were also some nice innovations during the development of Firefox 4, such as putting progress/links/status in the location bar, which unfortunately didn't make it to the final release.\n\nIn Firefox 29, Mozilla decided it would rework the UI again, and ended up removing the Add-on Bar as well.\n\nStatus-4-Evar aims to bring back the Status Bar / Add-on Bar with the familiar classic status bar items, give you more control over the built-in Firefox features, and provide new alternatives.\n\nThe extension provides \"Status Text\", \"Progress Meter\", \"Download Status\", and \"Legacy Status Bar\" (Firefox 29+) items. These toolbar items can be moved wherever you want by customizing the toolbars. Behavior of the toolbar items, and other additional settings, can be controlled in the Status-4-Evar preferences.\n\nThis extension can also act as a replacement for the Fission extension. There are preferences to show links, status, and progress in the location bar instead of the toolbar items.\n\nCheck out the code! S4E is now on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/SparkyBluefang/S4E\n\nWant to provide a translation? Status-4-Evar can be found on BabelZilla:\nhttp://www.babelzilla.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=6532\n\nKnown Issues\n\n    Firefox 4 - 28: by default, there is a flexible space on the Add-on Bar. When you install S4E, this flexible space gets replaced with the Status Text toolbar item. When you disable/uninstall S4E, this toolbar item obviously goes away. To \"fix\" the toolbar, all you have to do is customize the toolbar and put a flexible space between the close button and everything else.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nPlease do not email me for support/help/bug reports. I will not respond and will probably just delete it. The preferred way to contact me is to post in the official support topic on MozillaZine or create an issue on GitHub.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/55/55260.png?src=api&modified=1313365635","width":"700","height":"509","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/55/55260.png?src=api&modified=1313365635","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"145","caption":"S4E provides a handful of toolbar items replicating the functionality of the old status bar.

Some of them have to be moved to toolbars manually using browsers 'customize' area.\n\n\nFeatures & Settings (options window)\n\n    Tabs\n        Curved tabs (Australis default)\n        Squared tabs (classic)\n        Squared tabs (classic) (v2)\n        Squared tabs (australized)\n        Curved tabs (alternative)\n        Curved tabs (alternative Windows Aero)\n    Tabs on top \"true/false\"\n        Tabs on top, no [tabsontop] attribute (default)\n        Tabs on top + [tabsontop=\"true\"] attribute\n        Tabs not on top + [tabsontop=\"false\"] attribute\n    Tabs in titlebar (Firefox about:config switch)\n    Tabs max-width settings\n    Tabs min-width settings\n    Application button / application menu\n        appbutton hidden\n        appbutton on toolbars\n        appbutton on toolbars (text only)\n        appbutton on titlebar [Windows only]\n        appbutton on titlebar (icon only) [Windows only]\n    Application button / application menu color\n        orange\n        blue (Aurora)\n        black (Nightly)\n        transparent\n        blue (Palemoon)\n        red\n        green\n        gray\n        purple\n    Alternative icons (if appbutton on toolbar)\n    Higher button position (if on tabs toolbar) (Windows only)\n    Hide appbutons background color and borders\n    Add [iconsize=\"large\"]/[iconsize=\"small\"] attributes to #nav-bar\n    Small navigation toolbar buttons\n    Hide navigation toolbar\n    Movable back-forward button\n    Movable fullscreen controls (Windows)\n    Star-button in urlbar\n    Movable status-bar panel (CTR 1.1.8b3+)\n    Hide urlbars stop & reload buttons\n    Combine stop & reload buttons\n    Findbar\n        Findbar (default position)\n        Findbar on top (forced)\n        Findbar at the bottom (forced)\n        Findbar on top (forced) (alternative)\n        Findbar at the bottom (forced) (alternative)\n    Icons / Text\n        Show icons only\n        Show large icons (experimental)\n        Icons + text\n        Icons + text v2 (less space between buttons)\n        Text only\n    Custom colors for tab backgrounds, text and text shadow\n    Classic appmenu appearance for panel ui button on tabs toolbar\n    Remove tab toolbars background fog (Windows AeroGlass)\n    White color for some tab buttons (Windows)\n    White color for tab text (Windows)\n    Hide add-on bars close button\n    Fix urlbars border-radius, if needed\n    Alternative tab throbber animation images\n    Hide bookmarks menu buttons animation\n    Hide tab closing/opening animation (about:config switch)\n    Hide 'downloads complete' animation (about:config switch)\n    Always show 'tab close button'\n    Compact panel menus (bookmarks, history...)\n    CTR option buttons on customizing mode\n\n\nFeatures (not on options window)\n\n    Enable/disable Add-on Bar (toolbar context menu)\n    Toggle Add-on Bar using 'Ctrl + /' btw.

On MacOSX these tabs have reverse appearance like on pre-Australis builds.\n\nApplication button / application menu settings\n\nApplication menu titlebar button [Windows only]\nThe appmenu titlebar button is fixed on titlebars left side like on it was since Fx 4. It is enabled by default on Windows systems.\n\nApplication menu toolbar button\nThe appmenu toolbar button is a default toolbar menu button and can be placed on any available toolbar.\nIf it is moved to tabs toolbar while the menubar is disabled, the appbutton appears on browsers titlebar (Windows only). Otherwise it appears like a default toolbar button placed on any toolbar.\n\nApplication button colors\nOn tabs toolbar and on titlebar the appbutton can be colored orange, blue (Aurora), black (Nightly), transparent, blue (Palemoon), red, green and gray [in normal browsing mode] and purple [in private browsing mode] like on previous Windows browser versions.\n\nNote\nThe new appmenu is not an exact copy of the old one, but looks as original as possible. Some elements like 'splitmenu' are not available in Firefox Australis anymore, so menuitem and a submenu are placed in a row now. The appmenu also misses some non-cloneable menuitems inside developer- and options submenus.\n\nSmall nav-bar buttons\nNavigation toolbar buttons get alternative margins and paddings to simulate small icon view.\n\nHide 'Navigation Toolbar'\nHiding nav-bar might be interesting after its items get moved to other toolbars.\n\n'Add-on Bar'\nA toolbar at windows bottom simulates the 'old' add-on bar. All movable buttons and items can be placed on it. Add-on bar can be accessed through toolbars context menu (right-click on an existing toolbar) or can be toggled using 'Ctrl+/' (Windows/Linux) btw. 'Cmd+/' (MacOSX).\n\n'Additional Toolbar'\nAnother toolbar below top toolbars, where buttons and items can be moved to. It can be accessed through toolbars context menu (right-click on an existing toolbar).\n\nFindbar on top or at the bottom\nForces findbar to be displayed on top or at the bottom.\n\nIcons + text\nDisplay text below toolbar buttons.\n\nText only\nReplace toolbar button icons with text.\n\nBookmarks menu button\nThe bookmarks menu button is a default 'toolbar menu button'. On personal toolbar its label and icon are visible.\n\nBookmarks sidebar button\nThe bookmarks sidebar button toggles the bookmarks sidebar.\n\nHistory sidebar button\nThe history sidebar button toggles the history sidebar.\n\nBack-forward, reload and stop buttons\nBrowsers default buttons got merged with urlbar and cannot be moved to different toolbar positions or to different toolbars. CTB recreates these buttons.\n\nCombined reload-stop button\nPlace stop and reload buttons in that order on any toolbar and enable the corresponding option on CTRs preference window. Hover the option on options window to get extra information.\nToolbar: [something]...[stop-button][reload-button]...[something]\n\nSpaces and flexible spaces\nA couple of toolbar items simulate spaces and flexible spaces. They can be moved to toolbars like toolbar buttons using browsers customize menu.\n\nWindows - Linux - MacOSX\nThis add-on was tested on Windows 7 (AeroBasic, AeroGlass, Classic) & 8 & XP (Classic, Luna-Blue/Silver/Olive, Zune, Royale), Linux Mint KDE, Ubuntu and MacOSX 10.8/10.9. On other Systems or non OS-default themes tab colors may look wrong. Bookmarks, history, stop, reload, back and forward toolbar buttons use default OS icons (Firefox Windows icons on Windows systems, Firefox Mac icons on MacOSX and Firefox Linux icons on Linux systems).\n\nKnown 'issues'/'glitches'/extra info\n1) Application menus 'cut', 'copy' and 'paste' buttons do not always work like they should.\n2) Switching between AeroGlass and AeroBasic on Windows 7/Vista can change application buttons position, if the menubar is disabled. Maximizing/restoring browsers main window or restarting Firefox reslves the problem. This glitch is caused by MS Windows and titlebars behavior and not by this add-on.\n3) Tab colors on MacOSX fit to current ui instead of using pre-Australis colors. This is intended and not a bug.\n\nNotes\n1) Do not install this add-on on pre-Australis Firefox (4-28). It is not intended to be used with older versions and will certainly break some parts of the UI or not work correctly at all.\n2) This add-on was made for browsers default theme and will certainly break parts of the UI especially tabs, if used along with Firefox themes or Personas, but additional buttons and their options could work fine (untested!).","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/118/118349.png?src=api&modified=1396443041","width":"167","height":"125","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/118/118349.png?src=api&modified=1396443041","thumbnailWidth":"167","thumbnailHeight":"125","caption":"Main

For feedback or support use the support links above. Also see the home page for documentation.\n\nPOTENTIAL PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS:\n\n1. WARNING: IF YOU ENABLE ENCRYPTED SESSIONS AND RUN CCLEANER DO NOT ENABLE THE OPTION TO DELETE FIREFOX PASSWORDS. DOING SO WILL WIPE OUT THE KEY3.DB FILE IN YOUR FIREFOX PROFILE AND MAKE IT SO YOUR SESSION MANAGER SESSIONS CAN NOT BE DECRYPTED!\n\n2. Save button / menu item does not work and/or is grayed out - Likely your browser is set to \"Never remember history\" (i.e. permanent private browsing) history in the Privacy options. Due to Mozilla's policy that Add-ons MUST respect private browsing, Session Manager won't allow saving of private windows. This includes in backup sessions. Disable permanent private browsing and you will be able to save non-private windows again. If you don't like this, don't blame me, it's Mozilla's policy. See http://blog.mozilla.com/addons/2010/02/23/private-browsing-support-required-for-add-ons/\n\n3. Recovering from a crash doesn't work - Crash recovery won't work at all if the user sets the option to never remember history or start up in permanent private browsing mode since no crash recovery data is saved by the browser. If you want to be able to recover from crashes don't set the browser to never remember browser history.","reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/session-manager/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":431,"totalDownloads":3826364,"weeklyDownloads":10474,"dailyUsers":267929,"updateDate":1395773761000,"supportURL":"http://sessionmanager.mozdev.org/bugs.html"}]}
