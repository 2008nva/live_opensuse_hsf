While some of the status bar items did find new homes, you may not have like where they ended up. There were also some nice innovations during the development of Firefox 4, such as putting progress/links/status in the location bar, which unfortunately didn't make it to the final release.\n\nIn Firefox 29, Mozilla decided it would rework the UI again, and ended up removing the Add-on Bar as well.\n\nStatus-4-Evar aims to bring back the Status Bar / Add-on Bar with the familiar classic status bar items, give you more control over the built-in Firefox features, and provide new alternatives.\n\nThe extension provides \"Status Text\", \"Progress Meter\", \"Download Status\", and \"Legacy Status Bar\" (Firefox 29+) items. These toolbar items can be moved wherever you want by customizing the toolbars. Behavior of the toolbar items, and other additional settings, can be controlled in the Status-4-Evar preferences.\n\nThis extension can also act as a replacement for the Fission extension. There are preferences to show links, status, and progress in the location bar instead of the toolbar items.\n\nCheck out the code! S4E is now on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/SparkyBluefang/S4E\n\nWant to provide a translation? Status-4-Evar can be found on BabelZilla:\nhttp://www.babelzilla.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=6532\n\nKnown Issues\n\n    Firefox 4 - 28: by default, there is a flexible space on the Add-on Bar. When you install S4E, this flexible space gets replaced with the Status Text toolbar item. When you disable/uninstall S4E, this toolbar item obviously goes away. To \"fix\" the toolbar, all you have to do is customize the toolbar and put a flexible space between the close button and everything else.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nPlease do not email me for support/help/bug reports. I will not respond and will probably just delete it. The preferred way to contact me is to post in the official support topic on MozillaZine or create an issue on GitHub.","developerComments":null,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/55/55260.png?src=api&modified=1313340435","width":"700","height":"509","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/55/55260.png?src=api&modified=1313340435","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"145","caption":"S4E provides a handful of toolbar items replicating the functionality of the old status bar.

New tabs opened from links (or etc.) are automatically attached to the current tab. If you often use many many tabs, it will help your web browsing because you can understand relations of tabs.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* You can collapse/expand sub trees. It is convenient for too many tabs.\n* When you close a tab which has collapsed sub tree, all of tabs in the sub tree will be closed only one action.\n* The tree of tabs can be showin at rightside.\n* Vertical tab bar cab be shown/hidden automatically.\n* You can open new tab between existing tabs, dropping link or URL string there.\n* You can save/restore the tree of tabs over sessions, by Session Manager ( https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/2324 ) or other session-management addons.\n* Drag and drop is available to modify relations of tabs and to rearrange. The behavior seems to be like \"layer tree \" of Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop.\n* Tab bar can be moved to leftside, rightside, top, or bottom. Horizontal tree is also available.\n* This has an API for extension authors to open child tabs for existing tabs. (See also http://piro.sakura.ne.jp/xul/_treestyletab.html.en#api )\n\nThis is developed under a project to restructure TBE ( http://piro.sakura.ne.jp/xul/tabextension/index.html.en ) for Firefox 2. Multiple Tab Handler ( https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4838 ) can work with this. drag-and-do features of it will be more useful. Informational Tab ( https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4930 ) also works. With the Multiple Tab Handler, Firefox becomes like old Firefox powered by TBE.\n\nIf you don't want that Tree Style Tab automatically builds the tree of tabs, you should disable \"extensions.treestyletab.autoAttachNewTabsAsChildren\" by about:config. Then, you'll see tree only when you make a tree by hand, ex. drag and drop.\n\nSimilar Extensions:\nPano (tree in the sidebar, based on Panorama) https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/pano/\nTab Utilities (all-in-one addon for tabbed browsing, including vertical tab bar and tab groups) https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tab-utilities/\nTab Kit (all-in-one addon for tabbed browsing, including vertical tab bar and tree of tabs) https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/5447/\nVertical Tabs (alternative for TST + Multiple Tab Handler) https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/108862/\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nFor developers, Tree Style Tab provides public API.

With this add-on, you can visualize your passwords and the sites you use them on. By looking at this visualization, you can get a quick idea of which passwords you've been using the most, and the kinds of sites you're using them on. As you continue to change your passwords and update your password manager, the picture will improve!\n\nStart the visualization by clicking on the blue padlock in the add-on bar.\n\nThe visualization is fairly intuitive, but here's a quick summary of what this tool will tell you.\n\nThe green nodes represent distinct passwords you use. Hover over them to see a visual hash of your password, and click to view your password in clear text. The visual hashes are produced the same way as in the visual hashing add-on.\n\nThe blue nodes represent individual sites you use, and they're connected, by blue edges, to the green password nodes you use on that site.\n\nYou may also see orange box-shaped nodes that connect two password nodes. These are warnings about password similarity. Password similarity can be a wise and secure tool to use a single password across many different sites, so these warnings are not necessarily bad, or even a call to action. They connect passwords of the same \"family\".","developerComments":null,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/66/66766.png?src=api&modified=1326837822","width":"697","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/66/66766.png?src=api&modified=1326837822","thumbnailWidth":"199","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Here's an example visualization for a user with a great deal of password reuse."}],"homepageURL":"http://connectioni.st/2012/01/visualize-your-password-reuse.html","learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/password-reuse-visualizer/?src=api","supportURL":"http://connectioni.st","averageRating":4,"reviewCount":20,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/password-reuse-visualizer/reviews/?src=api","totalDownloads":38827,"weeklyDownloads":13,"dailyUsers":1087,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/204646/password_reuse_visualizer-0.13-fx.xpi?src=api","repositoryStatus":4,"size":325874,"updateDate":1367594972000,"isPlatformCompatible":true},{"id":"{AF445D67-154C-4c69-A17B-7F392BCC36A3}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/146/146354-32.png?modified=1455992415","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/146/146354-64.png?modified=1455992415"},"type":"extension","name":"Complete YouTube Saver","version":"5.6.53","creator":{"name":"cg-addons","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/cg-addons/?src=api"},"description":"Download YouTube videos in various formats including 1080p, 4K etc (DASH formats).

PLEASE READ!!!\n-The latest FFmpeg version is needed for muxing DASH videos (480p/1080p) and audio, please, update your FFmpeg here.\n-Debian/Ubuntu Linux users: your OS ships with an outdated version of FFmpeg, please, download the tested FFmpeg static binary for your system here.\n-Portable Firefox users, you can set up FFmpeg in your profile folder, see FAQ under FFmpeg\n-Please report bugs to cytsaver@hotmail.com\n-More updates on the way (comment page saves, etc)\n\n\nFeatures:\n-Download YouTube videos in 3GP, WebM, MP4, FLV, Full HD, 4K and 3D formats\n-Full, completely transparent support for all new adaptive streaming (DASH) video formats (480p/1080p etc)\n-Convert videos to MP3 or WAV, or save audio track in native format (Ogg Vorbis, AAC/M4A, MP3, OPUS)\n-Save YouTube page, video, subtitles, and comments pages to one folder\n-Free to use, contains no ads\n\n\nAbout Adaptive Streaming Videos (DASH)\nIn October 2013, YT stopped providing 480p and 1080p videos complete with audio. See: http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2013/10/youtube-drops-support-for-1080p-streams.html\n\n480p and 1080p are now video-only. There are separate audio streams to download and package together with these video streams to make MP4 files. CYS will do all this for you automatically in a process called “muxing”, with a single click, but you need to have the latest version of FFmpeg installed on your system and set up in CYS Options. Details are posted here.\n\nDASH videos can be identified in the list by the \"dash\" symbol on the left side column. Also, DASH videos contain three digits in the format number, from 133 and up, for example: “fmt 133”.\n\nWithout FFmpeg installed:\n-DASH video formats appear in the CYS list as MP4V files and contain NO AUDIO.\n\nWith FFmpeg installed:\n-DASH video formats appear in the CYS list as MP4 files. CYS will download the video and audio files and merge them automatically. DO NOT try to play the separate files while they are downloading. Wait until the two files merge and then you can play the resulting MP4 file.\n\nDepending on the video, the following DASH formats are available for download with CYS v5.4.4 (with FFmpeg installed):\n\nFmt 138 MP4 Original 2304p\nFmt 264 MP4 Ultra HD1440p\nFmt 137 MP4 Full HD 1080p\nFmt 136 MP4 HD 720p\nFmt 135 MP4 High Quality 480p\nFmt 134 MP4 SD 360p\nFmt 133 MP4 Low Quality 240p\nFmt 160 MP4 Low Quality 144p\n\nDASH WebM (VP9) formats where available:\n\nFmt 272 WebM Original 2304p\nFmt 271 WebM Ultra-HD 1440p\nFmt 248 WebM Full HD1080p\nFmt 247 WebM HD720p\nFmt 246 WebM High Quality480p\nFmt 245 WebMHigh Quality480p\nFmt 244 WebM High Quality 480p\nFmt 243 WebM SD360p\nFmt 242 WebMLow Quality240p\nFmt 278 WebM Low Quality 144p\n\n\nAbout FFmpeg and Audio Files:\nIn addition to muxing DASH videos, installing FFmpeg will allow you to do the following:\n-Convert audio from any YT video to high quality MP3 or WAV.\n-Save audio from any YT video in native format, without transcoding:\n>OGG Vorbis from WebM\n>AAC/M4A from MP4, FLV, 3GP\n>MP3 from FLV\n\nTo Enable MP3 Converter:\n1.Go to Options> General tab.\n2.Click on \"Download and install FFmpeg\" link.\n3.Follow directions.\n-Works with Windows, Mac and Linux.\n\nSave YouTube page, video, and comments pages to one folder:\n1.Hover over the format you wish to download.\n2.Select \"Save Complete YouTube Page\" from the menu.\n3.Click OK.\n\nWe value your opinion, but please, follow the review guidelines outlined here.

Per site settings with three configurable levels of accuracy or even the possibility to use a fixed location.","fullDescription":"Modern browsers such as Mozilla Firefox can tell websites where you're located in order to provide location-aware functionality. Your geographic location is obtained through various means (eg. using wifi data) and is often highly accurate, which can be a violation of your privacy.\n\nThis extension allows you to enjoy the useful applications of geolocation while protecting your privacy. It does so by reporting a fake location to websites, obtained by adding a certain amount of \"noise\" to the real location. The noise is randomly selected in a way that ensures that the real location cannot be inferred with high accuracy.\n\nThree configurable privacy levels are provided. The higher the privacy level the greater the amount of noise, which gives better privacy at the expense of a less accurate fake location. This can be configured per-website for flexibility: a more accurate location can be provided for driving directions than for a weather forecast. There's also an option to use a fixed location, instead of adding noise to the real one. This offers the best privacy (no dependence on the real location at all), at the cost of very low accuracy.\n\nNote: your location can be also detected from your IP address, but usually with poor accuracy. Location Guard protects the accurate location revealed through the javascript API.","developerComments":null,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/152/152196.png?src=api&modified=1422927979","width":"640","height":"400","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/152/152196.png?src=api&modified=1422927979","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"125","caption":"Location guard in use on openstreetmap.org"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/152/152198.png?src=api&modified=1422927979","width":"640","height":"400","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/152/152198.png?src=api&modified=1422927979","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"125","caption":"Privacy levels configuration."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/152/152264.png?src=api&modified=1422927980","width":"364","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/152/152264.png?src=api&modified=1422927980","thumbnailWidth":"104","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Location Guard on Android."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/152/152266.png?src=api&modified=1422927980","width":"367","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/152/152266.png?src=api&modified=1422927980","thumbnailWidth":"105","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Options page on Android."}],"homepageURL":"https://github.com/chatziko/location-guard","learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/location-guard/?src=api","supportURL":"https://github.com/chatziko/location-guard/issues","averageRating":4,"reviewCount":28,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/location-guard/reviews/?src=api","totalDownloads":382005,"weeklyDownloads":3292,"dailyUsers":40293,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/355524/location_guard-1.2.1-fx+an.xpi?src=api","repositoryStatus":4,"size":293863,"updateDate":1443334863000,"isPlatformCompatible":true},{"id":"langpack-ca@firefox.mozilla.org","icons":{"32":null,"64":null},"type":"locale","name":"Català Language Pack","version":"44.0","creator":{"name":"Mozilla","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/mozilla/?src=api"},"description":"Català Language Pack","fullDescription":null,"developerComments":null,"eula":null,"homepageURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/ca-language-pack/?src=api","learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/ca-language-pack/?src=api","supportURL":null,"averageRating":5,"reviewCount":1,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/ca-language-pack/reviews/?src=api","totalDownloads":30270,"weeklyDownloads":223,"dailyUsers":30270,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/390601/catala_language_pack-44.0-fx.xpi?src=api","repositoryStatus":4,"size":471474,"updateDate":1453743516000,"isPlatformCompatible":true},{"id":"langpack-es-CL@firefox.mozilla.org","icons":{"32":null,"64":null},"type":"locale","name":"Pack de idioma Español (Chile)","version":"44.0","creator":{"name":"Emilio Sepulveda","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/emilio-sepulveda/?src=api"},"developers":[{"name":"PaBLoX_CL","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/pablox_cl/?src=api"},{"name":"Mozilla","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/mozilla/?src=api"}],"description":"Pack de idioma español (Chile) para Firefox 3.0.x","fullDescription":"Versión experimental del paquete de idioma español para Chile (es-cl).

Session Manager doesn't display in the new minimized menu, but will still show in the old Tools menu which can be displayed by pressing the ALT key.\n\nPlease only post reviews here. For feedback or support use the support links above. Also see the home page for documentation.\n\nPOTENTIAL PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS:\n\n1. WARNING: IF YOU ENABLE ENCRYPTED SESSIONS AND RUN CCLEANER DO NOT ENABLE THE OPTION TO DELETE FIREFOX PASSWORDS. DOING SO WILL WIPE OUT THE KEY3.DB FILE IN YOUR FIREFOX PROFILE AND MAKE IT SO YOUR SESSION MANAGER SESSIONS CAN NOT BE DECRYPTED!\n\n2. Save button / menu item does not work and/or is grayed out - Likely your browser is set to \"Never remember history\" (i.e. permanent private browsing) history in the Privacy options. Due to Mozilla's policy that Add-ons MUST respect private browsing, Session Manager won't allow saving of private windows. This includes in backup sessions. Disable permanent private browsing and you will be able to save non-private windows again. If you don't like this, don't blame me, it's Mozilla's policy. See http://blog.mozilla.com/addons/2010/02/23/private-browsing-support-required-for-add-ons/\n\n3. Recovering from a crash doesn't work - Crash recovery won't work at all if the user sets the option to never remember history or start up in permanent private browsing mode since no crash recovery data is saved by the browser. If you want to be able to recover from crashes don't set the browser to never remember browser history.","eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/61/61138.png?src=api&modified=1341471852","width":"476","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/61/61138.png?src=api&modified=1341471852","thumbnailWidth":"136","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Session

On MacOSX tabs also get a 'reversed appearance'.\n\nApplication button / application menu settings\n\nApplication button on [Firefox] titlebar [Windows only]\nThe titlebar button is fixed on titlebars left like on Firefox since version 4.0. It is enabled by default on Windows systems.\n\nApplication button on toolbars\nOn toolbars the button appears like a default toolbar button.\n\nApplication button colours\nOn titlebar and tabs toolbar the application button can be orange, blue (Aurora), black (Nightly), blue (Palemoon), red, green and gray in normal browsing mode and purple in private browsing mode like on previous Firefox versions.\n\nNote\nThe new appmenu is not an exact copy of the old one, but looks as original as possible. The 'splitmenu' will not be restored and the appmenu popup/submenus also miss some non-replicable menuitems.\n\nSmall navigation toolbar buttons\nNavigation toolbar buttons get alternative margins and paddings to simulate old 'small icon view'.\n\nHide 'Navigation Toolbar'\nHiding navigation toolbar might be interesting after content got moved to other toolbars.\n\n'Add-on Bar'\nA toolbar at the bottom of the window. All movable buttons and items can be placed on it. Add-on bar can be enabled/disabled using toolbars context menu (right-click on a toolbar) or using 'Ctrl + /' (Windows/Linux) btw. 'Cmd + /' (MacOSX).\n\n'Additional Toolbar'\nA toolbar between navigation toolbar and bookmarks toolbar. It can be enabled/disabled using toolbars context menu (right-click on a toolbar).\n\nIcons + text / text only mode\nSimulates old icons + text / text modes where text was displayed below toolbar buttons or button icons got hidden.\n\nBookmarks menu button\nA default 'menu button' which opens the 'classic' bookmarks menu. Positioned on bookmarks toolbar the button also displays its label.\n\nBookmarks and history sidebar buttons\nButtons which toggle bookmarks and history sidebar.\n\nBack-forward, reload and stop buttons\nBrowsers default buttons got merged with urlbar and cannot be moved to different toolbar positions or to different toolbars. CTR adds duplicates of these buttons to the customization palette.\n\nCombined reload-stop button\nPlace reload button AFTER stop button and enable the corresponding option on CTRs preference window. Hovering the option on preference window to get extra information.\nToolbar: [something]...[stop-button][reload-button]...[something]\n\nSpaces, flexible spaces and separators\nThese toolbar items appear in customizing mode and can be moved to toolbars like on previous Firefox versions.\n\nWindows - Linux - MacOSX\nThis add-on was tested on Windows 7 (AeroBasic, AeroGlass, Classic) & 8(.1) & 10 & XP (Classic, Luna-Blue/Silver/Olive, Zune, Royale), Linux Mint KDE, Ubuntu and MacOSX 10.8/10.9/10.10. On other Systems or non OS-default themes tab colors may look wrong. Bookmarks, history, stop, reload, back and forward toolbar buttons use default OS icons (Firefox Windows icons on Windows systems, Firefox Mac icons on MacOSX and Firefox Linux icons on Linux systems).\n\nInfo, known 'issues', 'glitches', problems\n1) Application menus 'cut', 'copy' and 'paste' buttons do not always work like they should.\n2) Switching between AeroGlass and AeroBasic on Windows 7/Vista can change application buttons position, if the menubar is disabled. Maximizing/restoring browsers main window or restarting Firefox resolves the problem. This glitch is caused by Microsoft Windows and titlebars behavior and not by this add-on.\n3) Entering and leaving customizing mode 'disables' right-click menu items for bookmarks inside bookmarks menu button. A restart resolves this issue.\n4) Tab colors on MacOSX fit to current ui instead of using Firefox 28 colors. This is intended and not a bug.\n5) It is strongly recommended to remove Foxtab and Shareaholic before installing Firefox 29 or newer, because both add-ons break Firefox ui in Fx29+. Using Foxtab and/or Shareaholic with CTR causes even more errors, because CTR allows to move/remove more items than the default Firefox does.\nIf one of these add-ons has corrupted the ui, the add-ons manager has to be accessed via menubar (right-click on a toolbar -> select menubar, Tools -> add-ons) and Shareaholic and Foxtab have to be uninstalled and CTR has to be disabled. After a browser restart, CTR can be enabled again. After another restart \"restore defaults\" in customizing mode has to be hit once.\n\n##############################################\n\nIt is recommended to switch to a clean new profile or at least to trigger \"Restore Defaults\" in customizing mode to avoid UI issues after upgrading from Firefox 28 (and older) to Firefox 29 (and newer). Profile Switcher can help too.\n\n##############################################\n\nAVAST AV software,\"Browser Cleanup\" and disappearing Firefox add-ons\nIf Avasts \"Browser Cleanup\" still accidentally removes Firefox add-ons consider removing or disabling \"Browser Cleanup\" feature.\n\n##############################################\n\ngHacks.net article (10 Reasons why you may want to

It is not officially available for MAC, but for those who would like to try it anyway on that platform, you can force download (regardless if it is the Windows or the Linux file) and once the package downloaded on your computer, you can install it manually by clicking the \"tools\" button in the add-ons manager and then selecting \"install an add-on from file...\".\nIt contains no added functionalities, it's simply a full Firefox's GUI aesthetic customization.\n\n• Userstyles to customize a bit more your FT Deepdark (such as : dark \"about:home\", \"aero style\" for tabs and tab bar background, translucent scrollbars, darker url bar background, ...) are available at userstyles.org\n• IMPORTANT ! To use these \"userstyles\" you need first to install an add-on called \"Stylish\"\n\n• FT DEEPDARK 14beta9 available on the FT DeepDark's \"version history\" page\n\n• WHAT TO DO WHEN FACING AN ISSUE WITH FT DEEPDARK ?\n\n1) before reporting it, first try to see if the issue is due to the theme itself. How ? Enable the default theme and check if the issue is still there. If not, enable again the FT theme, but disable all other installed addons to check if the issue can be due to a conflict between addons.\n\n2) If the issue is still there after disabling all other addons and if the default theme doesn t have that issue, try to download and install again the theme (check also if you have the latest version installed, maybe the bug you want to report has already been solved with the latest updates).\n\n3) if after trying what mentioned above the problem is linked with the use of the FT theme, please, send me an e-mail (there is a link on the add-ons page to contact me) instead of reporting the bug in the add-on's review section. When sending an e-mail to report a bug, do not forget to tell me which operating system (Windows XP, 7, Vista, Linux, etc.) you are running on your computer, which version of Firefox and FT theme you are using and if you have any operating system custom theme (it can also be a cause of the issue). Then, describe the most precisely you can the issue you are facing and, if possible, please, join a screenshot and/or a short video so I could see exactly how it looks (English is not my mother tongue as you can easily notice, so a picture can avoid the language problems). All that will help me to understand better what is the problem and to solve it quicker if possible.\nI can t promise you that I ll manage to fix every problems and also in short time, but I ll do my best for it. I m working on my themes during my free time so it can take a bit time before fixing the issues (you need also to be conscious that any updates need to be checked by Mozilla first, but if you want to have the updates a bit quicker you can follow me on Twitter and know immediately when a new version is available for download).","developerComments":"Special thanks to :\n\nAxel G., Ken S., Ken B. and Ivana R.","eula":"Free for non-commercial personal use.

Cookies","version":"0.4.9","creator":{"name":"Ove","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/ovso/?src=api"},"description":"Fix the web. Gets rid of a site's cookies and LocalStorage as soon as you close its tabs. Protects against trackers and zombie-cookies. Trustworthy services can be whitelisted.","fullDescription":"Self-Destructing Cookies is not just a cookie manager, it's a new cookie policy. Do you think that cookies should need a reason to persist in your cookie jar, i.e. you currently interacting with the site that set them? Would you prefer your cookie jar to be empty in its steady state, except for a few sites that you care about? Are you worried about unconventional tracking methods? Then give this add-on a try.\n\nSelf-Destructing Cookies automatically removes cookies when they are no longer used by open browser tabs. With the cookies, lingering sessions, as well as information used to spy on you, will be expunged. Websites will only be permitted to identify you while you actually use them and can not stalk you across the entire web. This is the closest you will get to cookieless browsing without breaking every second site or tedious micromanaging.\n\nTracking cookies will be detected and removed immediately. They are identified purely by their behaviour - no need for a blacklist that needs to be kept up to-date. Self-Destructing Cookies also has LocalStorage support and will treat it just like your cookie jar. Defend yourself against ETag tracking and other cache-based black-hat techniques by configuring Self-Destructing Cookies to automatically clean your cache every time you are not actively using the browser. For the first time ever, this provides a realistic chance of beating zombie-/evercookies without sacrificing usability. See the zombie-cookie FAQ entry for details. Self-Destructing Cookies can also help protect against CSRF attacks by ending your sessions as soon as possible.\n\nThis add-on complements blacklist-based solutions such as Adblock and Ghostery very well. You can whitelist sites whose cookies and LocalStorage you would like to keep without an active tab in the Firefox cookie exception list, which can also be conveniently accessed from the add-on's preferences, or an icon in the Add-on Bar.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions and Common Problems\n\nQ: What about Zombie-/Evercookies?\nA: SDC gives you a fighting chance against such black-hat techniques. To beat the Evercookie, enable automatic cache cleaning in SDC's preferences. If you are on a decent, unmetered connection, there is no harm in setting the idle timeout to a low value, such as 3 minutes. You should also set all of your plugins to click-to-play, install BetterPrivacy and configure it to automatically clean unused LSOs. Please note that SDC will not clean LocalStorage scopes of sites served via HTTPS if you are running a Firefox version prior to 23. This is due to a limitation in Firefox's DOM storage API in those versions.\n\nQ: Can I disable the notification pop-ups?\nA: Yes. Open the add-on manager. You can reach it via Firefox's menu, or by just entering \"about:addons\" without the quotes in your location bar. Locate Self-Destructing Cookies in your list of extensions, click the Preferences button and remove the checkmark next to \"Notifications\".\n\nQ: Since I installed the add-on, the removal notifications just won't stop. I'm not even using the browser at the moment.\nA: You are probably using another add-on that re-adds certain cookies when they are removed, e.g. Beef Taco or TrackerBlock which both try to persist opt-out cookies. SDC and the other add-on are having an infinite debate about whether to keep those cookies. Choose a side and disable the other one.\n\nQ: The entire whitelist is empty each time I restart Firefox.\nA: You probably have Firefox's privacy preferences set to \"Clear History when Firefox closes\" and included \"Site Preferences\" in the corresponding menu. SDC's whitelist is stored as site preferences.\n\nQ: A specific site forgets my login, even though it is on my whitelist.\nIf you added the entries manually, make sure you whitelisted the base domains of your sites (e.g. \"example.com\", not \"www.example.com\"). That's where cookies are generally stored.\nIf you added it via the icon, the login might depend on external domains. Keep an eye on the removal notifications the next time you log *in* there. The domains that appear in the following seconds are probably the ones you want on your whitelist as well.\n\nQ: The add-on does not work in private browsing mode.\nA: Some parts of Firefox are off-limits for add-ons while you are in private browsing mode. This includes the cookie jar for example. There's nothing I can do about this, sorry.\n\nQ: I have configured Firefox to block all cookies by default. Can I still use SDC?\nA: There is an unsupported hidden setting that changes the behaviour of the \"yellow\" whitelist level from allow-for-session to allow-while-open. To enable it, create a boolean key in your about:config named \"extensions.jid0-9XfBwUWnvPx4wWsfBWMCm4Jj69E@jetpack.defaultBlock\" (without the quotes), set it to true and restart your browser. You can now use the \"yellow\" setting for sites whose cookies you would like to accept, but still have them self-destruct. I provide this on a \"should work\" basis, meaning that I depend on bug reports from you and don't do in-depth testing of this mode myself.","developerComments":null,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/98/98894.png?src=api&modified=1367914213","width":"650","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/98/98894.png?src=api&modified=1367914213","thumbnailWidth":"186","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Gets rid of a site's cookies as soon as you close its last tab."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/98/98896.png?src=api&modified=1367914213","width":"587","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/98/98896.png?src=api&modified=1367914213","thumbnailWidth":"168","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Detects and removes trackers without the need for a blacklist - purely by their behaviour.

For web forms, the typical usage is as follows:\n\n    Navigate to the page containing the login form.\n    Right-click on one of its fields and select from among \"Save login info\" (to create a new entry), \"Edit login info\", and \"Delete login info\".\n    If another popup appears, select the username for the entry you want to operate on.\n    If adding a new entry, everything except the username and password should be filled in automatically. Fill in anything that is missing or incorrect.\n    If adding or editing an entry, reload the page or return later. If the form doesn't get autofilled, most likely the page is asking the browser not to autofill it by declaring autocomplete=\"off\". Try clicking twice on the username field and selecting from the dropdown list. There is a video demonstrating this workaround.\n\nThis add-on also adds commands to the Password Manager window, which it makes accessible through Tools > Saved Passwords as well as a toolbar button.\n\nA short tutorial video is available.\n\nIf you need support, please go to the support web site I have listed or email me (link on the details page, next to this description). Never use a review for this, as I have no real way of contacting you. For anything else, please see the Developer Comments near the bottom of the details page.\n\nBitcoin donations. Suggested amount 0.01-0.02 BTC.","developerComments":"Currently supported applications: Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, and Conkeror.\n\nIf you find this add-on useful, you might find QuickPasswords useful as well. For those more stubborn sites where the Password Manager and this add-on completely fail, try iMacros for Firefox.\n\nLogo/icon by PlastikManiac — thanks.\n\nYou can find the source code repository at GitHub.
