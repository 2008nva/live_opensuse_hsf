While some of the status bar items did find new homes, some did not, and you might not like where they ended up. There were also some nice innovations during the development of Firefox 4.0, such as progress/links/status in the location bar, which unfortunately didn't make it to the final release.\n\nStatus-4-Evar aims to bring back (some of) the old status bar items, give you more control over the built-in Firefox features, and provide new alternatives.\n\nThe extension provides \"Status Text\", \"Progress Meter\", and \"Download Status\" items. These toolbar items can be moved wherever you want by customizing the toolbars. Behavior of the toolbar items, and other additional settings, can be controlled in the extension preferences.\n\nThis extension can also act as a replacement for the Fission extension. There are preferences to show links, status, and progress in the location bar instead of the toolbar items.\n\nKnown Issues\n\n    Firefox 4 - 28: by default, there is a flexible space on the Add-on Bar. When you install S4E, this flexible space gets replaced with the Status Text toolbar item. When you disable/uninstall S4E, this toolbar item obviously goes away. To \"fix\" the toolbar, all you have to do is customize the toolbar and put a flexible space between the close button and everything else.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nCheck out the code! S4E is now on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/SparkyBluefang/S4E\n\nWant to provide a translation? Status-4-Evar can be found on BabelZilla:\nhttp://www.babelzilla.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=6532\n\nPlease do not email me for support/help/bug reports. I will not respond and will probably just delete it.

computer.\n\nIt provides the following advantages over the built-in save system:\n— A complete page can be saved as a single file (web archive)\n— You can name files using the title of the page (title save)\n— The saved pages are faithful to the original (exact save)\n\nYou can view and save MHT (MHTML) files, with excellent compatibility with Internet Explorer;\nbut more importantly, you can use the MAFF file format, with the following advantages:\n— Save disk space, since MAFF files are compressed\n— Include video and audio embedded in the pages\n— Be universal, since MAFF is based on ZIP and compatible with Linux and other platforms\n— Use an open format, with no risk of vendor lock-in\n\nThe MAFF format is exceptional when combined with the built-in browser support for the Ogg Vorbis and Ogg Theora media formats in web pages: you can save everything in a single file. You can even save more than one tab in a single MAFF file.\n\nThe MAF extension allows you to convert your already saved pages to the format of your choice. You can use this feature to save disk space, or even to convert MAFF to the other formats, should you ever decide to go back.\n\nMAF also interoperates with other extensions, for example:\n— Multiple Tab Handler (easily select the tabs to save)\n— UnMHT (additional expert features to read and write MHTML)\n\nThe MAF extension is intuitive and easy to use, but empowers you with advanced features: see the user manual if you want to find out more!\n\nDo you think something could be improved? Let us know!\n\nBut don't forget to check out the latest development version first: maybe the feature you need is already there!","developerComments":"• In order to open MHTML files when the IE Tab extension is installed, the filter /^file:\\/\\/\\/.*\\.(mht|mhtml)$/ must be disabled from the IE Tab options.\n• The Download Sort extension has a known incompatibility with MAF.

If you often use many many tabs, it will help your web browsing because you can understand relations of tabs.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* You can collapse/expand sub trees. It is convenient for too many tabs.\n* When you close a tab which has collapsed sub tree, all of tabs in the sub tree will be closed only one action.\n* The tree of tabs can be showin at rightside.\n* Vertical tab bar cab be shown/hidden automatically.\n* You can open new tab between existing tabs, dropping link or URL string there.\n* You can save/restore the tree of tabs over sessions, by Session Manager ( https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/2324 ) or other session-management addons.\n* Drag and drop is available to modify relations of tabs and to rearrange. The behavior seems to be like \"layer tree \" of Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop.\n* Tab bar can be moved to leftside, rightside, top, or bottom. Horizontal tree is also available.\n* This has an API for extension authors to open child tabs for existing tabs. (See also http://piro.sakura.ne.jp/xul/_treestyletab.html.en#api )\n\nThis is developed under a project to restructure TBE ( http://piro.sakura.ne.jp/xul/tabextension/index.html.en ) for Firefox 2. Multiple Tab Handler ( https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4838 ) can work with this. drag-and-do features of it will be more useful. Informational Tab ( https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4930 ) also works. With the Multiple Tab Handler, Firefox becomes like old Firefox powered by TBE.\n\nIf you don't want that Tree Style Tab automatically builds the tree of tabs, you should disable \"extensions.treestyletab.autoAttachNewTabsAsChildren\" by about:config.

Advanced traceroutes with three protocols simultaneously (TCP/UDP/ICMP)\n- ping and traceroute from your computer\n- links to Looking Glasses of 43 global providers (by provider name or by country/city). Not every global provider has an open LG\n- whois, BGP connections on bgp.he.net\n- DNS ping and custom request to any server\n\n- verification of compliance of the website with the IP address, protection against DNS spoofing / DNS hijacking. These attacks are used by different viruses and trojans, some unscrupulous providers, governments and security agencies.\n\nDNS attacks redirect legitimate traffic to a fake website, or when proxying traffic in the Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks for different purposes such as\n\n- stealing passwords\n- listening to internet traffic\n- providing falsified information\n- intercepting online banking transactions\n- for censorship.\n\nDNS requests are sent to a randomly selected server from the list prescribed in the options. To detect DNS spoofing, the address is verified through an external DNS server as well.\n\nBy default, there are the fastest public servers from Google and Level3 in the list. Additionally, it is recommended to use DNS servers from OpenNIC independent of companies and governments (link in the options). Here you can read more about the project.\n\nIf spoofing is suspected, the additional DNS requests to 8.8.8.8 and to the website's DNS server (from NS entries) are possible by using the TCP protocol.\n\nFrom the version 3.0.0, all requests to WIP database will only be sent via https for more protection and security (also against PRISM, xkeyscore, tempora). They will be redirected to the server located on the same continent, where the user is. That is, all European requests are sent to the European server, etc.. Our servers are in the United States, Germany, Chile, Singapore, Japan and Australia.\n\nWorldIP is a WIPmania's product based on WIP-database. Its results are based on data from core routers, so it is more correct than the other databases based on whois (those databases only provide the geographical location of the network owner but not the geographical location of the network itself).\n\nIPv6 support is incomplete and experimental.\nAll requests are asynchronous, so WorldIP does not slow down the site loading time.\n\nIf you noticed a bug, please report it to mail@wipmania.com or via bug report system worldip.userecho.com\n\nIf you constantly get the red spoofing-sign, please check whether your external DNS work.
