0.8.0:
	* Transition to OpenSUSE 13.2
	* LXQt 0.8 update (Qt4 version due to Qt5 build's instability)
		be wary, nitrogen is used to control desktop wallpapers instead of pcmanfm-qt
	* Enlightenment removed due to inability to login
	* file persistency is enabled (may work extremely slow on slow R/W media like bad flash)
	* printer and scaner support added due to occasional usefulness
	* YaST firewall is disabled by default to ensure connectivity
	* all audio I/O goes to JACK now, default user is allowed realtime
		PA runs as JACK client, uses echo cancellation by default
		pure ALSA also redirects to JACK
		OSS apps (like tvtime) can use JACK via PA's 'padsp'
		JAMin is used before output to enhance sound, defaults to low & high boost + DRC
		QJackCtl, QasMixer and PASysTray are used for control and configuration
	* colour is managed via colord with argyllCMS, dispcalGUI and xiccd
	* LeechCraft-Azoth now supports audio calls
	* Tox P2P IM audio/video protocol is fully supported
		(GTK & ncurses Tox clients + libpurple-plugin for LC-Azoth)
	* all logging completely directed into systemd-journal
		and it should shit less into console
	* GoldenDict, the ultimate dictionary, is updated from its ancient version
	* PCI & USB ids, smartdb and CAs always updated before creating image
	* Custom build of Firefox with:
		system libjpeg-turbo, libpng, cairo, pixman, libvpx,
			sqlite, libevent, hunspell, icu, ffi, bz2
		No compile optimisations:
			 (O3 breaks png rendering, LTO is still flacky and PGO needs X on building for correct results)
		No direct JACK support (PA is quite hardcoded now, unfortunately)
		disabled crash reporting, accessibility
		enabled stripping, disabled '-g' flag
	* sudo now handles GUI apps and can replace xdg-su/kdesu/gksu
